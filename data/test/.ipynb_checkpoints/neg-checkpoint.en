<n> The V@@ CR still works , but h@@ te DVD side is us@@ eless .
<n> To me that &apos; s a sign on bad quality .
<n> It doesn &apos; t even work anymore and I use my broken PS@@ 2 Now .
<n> The d@@ v@@ d player gave me problems probably after a year of having it .
<n> DVD menu select problems : I cannot sc@@ roll through a DVD menu that is set up ver@@ tically .
<n> No special features , no language select , nothing , just play .
<n> Very frustr@@ ating , and the game absolutely will not work for me .
<n> :@@ ( I sent it back .
<n> No one will help me with this problem .
<n> Wa@@ ste of money !
<n> Three Days of Use and It Bro@@ ke : Very disappointed in this product .
<n> unlike the &quot; dark &quot; series , you really did@@ nt feel any passion .
<n> A Lo@@ st Auth@@ or : I have read all of the Car@@ path@@ ian no@@ vels to date , except one .
<n> I was hoping to find out more about this cur@@ se , the origins and why the m@@ ales kill the fem@@ ales .
<n> Nothing , not a word about the J@@ agu@@ ar cur@@ se .
<n> What a shame .
<n> The movie loses it &apos; s true premis@@ e of having depth in amongst the terrible & cru@@ de &quot; j@@ ok@@ es &@@ quot@@ ;@@ .
<n> It is a constant bar@@ rage of pa@@ thetic behavior .
<n> Very Dis@@ appointing .
<n> I thought the story began well enough , but the ending was l@@ ame .
<n> V@@ ast@@ ly over@@ rated work of fiction : I was sor@@ ely disappointed in this v@@ ap@@ id and sm@@ army demo@@ go@@ gu@@ ery .
<n> I would read it only if you want to know why the lun@@ atic f@@ rin@@ ge is so nut@@ ty & ir@@ rational .
<n> So , the manufacturer can &apos; t say that I didn &apos; t take good care of it .
<n> CA@@ US@@ ES BR@@ U@@ IS@@ ING AND BL@@ IS@@ TER@@ S IF W@@ OR@@ N TO@@ O LON@@ G : I ordered this product to sli@@ m down my stom@@ ach .
<n> Not happy : I was really un@@ happy with this .
<n> nice product : My wife lo@@ ves it but we unfortunately per@@ ch@@ ac@@ ed the wrong size .
<n> She was really exc@@ ited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn &apos; t fit .
<n> There is very little character development , movie - like dialogue , and plenty of min@@ dless action .
<n> but i don@@ t think that dis is dat gu@@ d of a book 2 recommend ... i did@@ nt like it 2 much but ...
<n> P@@ ain@@ ful : This book has to be one of the most te@@ di@@ ous works of literature ever written .
<n> M@@ ist@@ ake ?
<n> Nothing truly interesting happens in this book .
<n> : As good as this book may be , the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it .
<n> We &apos; ve all seen the tri@@ ck , so it &apos; s just not interesting anymore .
<n> one of the worst movies of 2002 : go@@ d !@@ !@@ !
<n> what a dum@@ b movie .
<n> very disappointing : The movie is vul@@ gar and not meant for children .
<n> Not enjoyable at all .
<n> If you are still in the gri@@ ev@@ ing stage , this book will not help you .
<n> Re@@ ally , why even bo@@ ther ?
<n> Very frustr@@ ating .
<n> Very poor quality .
<n> From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic char@@ gers until my computer is totally dead .
<n> This one may have just been a bad example .
<n> I didn &apos; t finish the book , it was a waste of time .
<n> Di@@ stur@@ bing .
<n> Not Very good : I don@@ t advise buying this gri@@ der , it broken when i pressed it .
<n> Dis@@ appointing .
<n> Band sav@@ es CD : As usual , Dol@@ ly continues trying to sing but has no voice .
<n> worst book in the world !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> : This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life !
<n> I was forced to read it for school .
<n> It was complicated and very bor@@ ing .
<n> I would not recommend this book to anyone !@@ !
<n> I tried to leave feedback for E@@ ID@@ OS , but to no av@@ ail .
<n> Del@@ ay after delay .
<n> I had one disappointment after another .
<n> I have given up many times in she@@ ar fru@@ stration .
<n> Fru@@ stration I haven &apos; t felt in her other games .
<n> Al@@ as , there is also no index .
<n> a terrible product : this is not well manufactured i reci@@ ev@@ ed it in a timely manner .
<n> and the scre@@ ws didn &apos; t fit well .
<n> i was really disappointed in it .
<n> B@@ U@@ Y@@ ER B@@ EW@@ ARE : This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time .
<n> Software is Hor@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> : This software is not user friendly .
<n> The samples don &apos; t help .
<n> Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store .
<n> Very Dis@@ appointing .
<n> Po@@ or quality and high price ... are these kno@@ ck - off@@ s ?
<n> What a disappointment !
<n> After the Fire is a disappointing read .
<n> What bo@@ ther@@ ed me the most is the character of Hy@@ ac@@ in@@ th - what a weak and stup@@ id woman !
<n> Any mother will fight to the end for her children .
<n> F@@ ailed to Work : I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista .
<n> Ma@@ themati@@ cal non@@ sense : Ma@@ them@@ atically speaking , this book is all non@@ sense .
<n> For instance , the author argu@@ es that own@@ ing a home is more expensive than not own@@ ing .
<n> But after the first pages , I knew that this was a mistake .
<n> Is very re@@ peti@@ tive and some of the content really ridicul@@ ous for this age and time .
<n> Stu@@ ck With You : I didn &apos; t really like the book .
<n> l@@ ous@@ y , out@@ dated guide , with hor@@ ri@@ ble printing f@@ laws !
<n> broken :@@ (@@ : The base and frame were not completely attached .
<n> L@@ ous@@ y R@@ F range ; ON worked from further away than O@@ FF : The range of use was practically us@@ eless .
<n> E@@ ver see a bad review in AN@@ Y of the gun magazines ?
<n> The re@@ trac@@ table cor@@ d broke after a short time .
<n> After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on - off button was broken as well !
<n> waste of time and money !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> This is a worth@@ less piece of j@@ unk !
<n> Do not waste your time on this su@@ b - standard , hor@@ ri@@ bly designed and made product !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> : This over - priced pain in &quot; the sitting area &quot; has an always - on , g@@ lar@@ ing RE@@ D light .
<n> * Red lights are commonly used to war@@ n of an immediate danger that requires attention NO@@ W .
<n> * NO - I don &apos; t have a carbon Mon@@ ox@@ ide problem .
<n> Cra@@ p , Jun@@ k , Wor@@ th@@ less , etc : The other 1 - star po@@ ster is absolutely correct ; these things are cra@@ p .
<n> It is not true , obviously .
<n> The title is misleading .
<n> Also , the pun@@ ches are very d@@ ull and not uni@@ form@@ ly shar@@ pen@@ ed ( or dul@@ led , however you look at it )@@ .
<n> I have difficulties cutting through even thin , soft sili@@ cone sheets .
<n> D@@ ull and dirty : Well I don &apos; t usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product . 1@@ r@@ st .
<n> No foot@@ notes or primary sources listed for such conclusions ?@@ ?
<n> I love every other Night World book , but this is retar@@ ded .
<n> I was particularly dis@@ ma@@ yed by seem@@ ingly endless accounts of men ( in black ) beh@@ aving badly .
<n> SH@@ AM@@ E ON YOU M@@ R . KE@@ EL !@@ !@@ !
<n> : 25@@ 7 pages covering Men in Black , lights in the sky , and phone troub@@ les .
<n> I had absolutely no clu@@ e was was going on in this book .
<n> Just cra@@ zy ! Just a few of my favour@@ ites :@@ &quot; so hor@@ ri@@ fied she dropped the small baby in her arms .
<n> The child began to c@@ ry , more ins@@ ul@@ ted than h@@ urt .@@ &quot;
<n> I &apos; m thinking the kids was more h@@ urt than ins@@ ul@@ ted .
<n> Seri@@ ously , the be@@ ats her singing is lay@@ ered over are tired and c@@ lich@@ Ã©@@ d .
<n> Fin@@ al Ver@@ dict : Bad music .
<n> nor@@ it@@ ake color@@ wave st@@ one@@ ware : I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company .
<n> Instead , I found myself not car@@ ing about the nar@@ r@@ ator whatsoever .
<n> Wor@@ st book I &apos; ve ever read : This has got to be one of the most de@@ pressing books I have ever read .
<n> Search the web for &quot; can@@ on z@@ r users group &quot; and &quot; eating tap@@ es &quot; to hear similar hor@@ ror stories .
<n> E@@ h@@ h : The disc is int@@ act but the case is in terrible oc@@ n@@ dition .
<n> It is broken in half and chi@@ pped off of the top portion of the case .
<n> If this is &quot; true &quot; N@@ ir@@ v@@ ana , then &quot; true &quot; N@@ ir@@ v@@ ana su@@ cks .
<n> There are quite a few anno@@ ying ty@@ pos .
<n> Ex@@ pen@@ sive experiment that didn &apos; t work : I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use .
<n> Most disappointing .
<n> To see that many mar@@ ti@@ al artists are scre@@ aming their cre@@ denti@@ als and rank is making me tired .
<n> This edition is dis@@ appoint@@ ingly and , in my hum@@ ble opinion , un@@ necessarily small .
<n> Can I shoot myself now ?@@ ?
<n> : A few years back I was forced to read &quot; T@@ ess &quot; for my English class .
<n> A@@ w@@ ful : This was one of the worst books I have ever read .
<n> Cru@@ el and Dep@@ res@@ sing St@@ ory : Har@@ dy pain@@ ts a cru@@ el picture of women in lower society .
<n> They are either temp@@ ted or cause evil mis@@ chief with a tragic ending .
<n> I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression .
<n> : T@@ ess was a very bor@@ ing book .
<n> The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are lau@@ gh@@ able by to@@ days standards .
<n> I h@@ ated this book then ....@@ : ... and h@@ ate it now .
<n> My only re@@ ven@@ ge for being forced to read T@@ ess as a k@@ id is to write a negative review as an adult .
<n> Bad purch@@ ace .
<n> Um@@ mm : I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it .
<n> Big mistake .
<n> Sel@@ f In@@ dul@@ gent Non@@ sense : The operative word from the title is &quot; b@@ ums &@@ quot@@ ;@@ .
<n> Out@@ lines of The@@ ology , AA Ho@@ dge : Kin@@ dle edition : Very disappointed .
<n> : I p@@ re ordered this thinking it was a great deal for 18 $ but I was so wrong !
<n> Stor@@ y@@ telling is like fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king . Too many pl@@ ots to cover , hor@@ ri@@ ble pac@@ ing , no depth .
<n> : This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see .
<n> I found it to be a total waste of my time .
<n> This movie really su@@ cked !
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble : Absol@@ utely rub@@ b@@ ish .
<n> Simply not good by any measure .
<n> Every 10 - 15 , the movie would stop and pop up the error message .
<n> Optim@@ us prime getting tra@@ pped in a b@@ unch of c@@ ables for 20@@ mins of the movie ?
<n> It &apos; s an over@@ long m@@ ess with the C@@ G@@ I eye cand@@ y being the only re@@ de@@ em@@ ing factor of this film .
<n> Making a movie longer is not making a movie better .
<n> She was so anno@@ ying and sp@@ ends most of the film posing and p@@ ou@@ ting pret@@ ti@@ ly .
<n> What could possibly go wrong ?
<n> Bad Mo@@ vie By A Bad W@@ rest@@ ler : Do not bo@@ ther !
<n> H@@ ell no .
<n> pa@@ thetic .
<n> What a complete and utter waste of time , and money .
<n> First off the movie gets started in a cra@@ zy action scene / war f@@ las@@ h@@ back .
<n> Please avoid this re@@ ek@@ ing explo@@ ding cro@@ ck of ....
<n> There &apos; s some problem with the program you download from emark@@ er . com .
<n> The program has problems loading the emark@@ er USB drive into your computer .
<n> If I were you , I &apos; d wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems .
<n> How stup@@ id , does son@@ y believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it .
<n> Ac@@ tually , even if you do have a cable or d@@ s@@ l line , its still us@@ eless .
<n> worth@@ less : Where is the space for a zero star !
<n> Just purchased a emark@@ er and ill tell you one thing , I should have read these reviews first .
<n> The site is terrible and I c@@ ant even get the program to &quot; enable &quot; itself .
<n> Unfortunately , I didn &apos; t pay enough attention to the war@@ nings that the product doesn &apos; t work .
<n> I was wrong .
<n> Absol@@ utely ru@@ ined it .
<n> Absol@@ utely terrible , the new illustr@@ ator must have no dignity to ru@@ in this .
<n> I am not keeping this books as they are worth@@ less to me without the better art@@ work .
<n> Dis@@ appointed : This video was let down .
<n> Ry@@ an &apos; s Rev@@ enge : A surpris@@ ingly bad film , pain@@ fully slow pac@@ ed and con@@ vol@@ uted .
<n> It really is one hell of a m@@ ess .
<n> Some@@ thing has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in &quot; best &quot; quality .
<n> An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out gar@@ b@@ led j@@ unk .
<n> It has been a waste of money to me -- especially when ink car@@ tri@@ dges are so high for it !
<n> I thought this was hor@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> Even a woman with fighting skills .
<n> How ut@@ terly stup@@ id !
<n> Foundation is bad .
<n> Not a good book to pick up occasionally , takes a foc@@ uss@@ ed reading .
<n> Stay A@@ way : This just plain bad .
<n> It was a waste of my time .
<n> worst ....@@ ..... movie ....@@ ....@@ .... ever : Go break open a red light camera and ste@@ al the film .
<n> Blu - Ray Review : What a terrible movie , gar@@ b@@ age .
<n> It totally su@@ cks .
<n> He now has absolutely NO range .
<n> The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie .
<n> N@@ ic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble .
<n> The lines were H@@ OR@@ R@@ IB@@ LE !
<n> : So he &apos; s a dirty c@@ op and an all around hor@@ ri@@ ble person .
<n> Ban@@ al and B@@ oring : No , I &apos; m not making this up .
<n> I was really disappointed , I returned mine ..
<n> If I ha@@ d@@ n &apos; t gotten this book for a ste@@ al I would have been very up@@ set at my waste of money .
<n> What a waste .
<n> aw@@ ful : Big waste of money !
<n> I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be ab@@ using drugs themselves !
<n> Ty@@ pos , poor punc@@ tu@@ ation , etc .
<n> ru@@ ined it for me .
<n> Cri@@ min@@ ally stup@@ id mistake to not provide the or@@ g@@ inal sound : Don &apos; t buy this Video .
<n> A@@ W@@ F@@ U@@ L : This was the absolute W@@ OR@@ ST book that I have ever read .
<n> It the dul@@ l@@ est , most bor@@ ing thing since I learned al@@ geb@@ ra .
<n> After the first chapter , I already wanted to kill myself .
<n> The recording is a m@@ ess .
<n> The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it .
<n> Very poor quality .
<n> TH@@ E@@ Y ALL LE@@ AK@@ ED R@@ IG@@ HT F@@ ROM THE B@@ EG@@ IN@@ N@@ ING , SO@@ ME W@@ OR@@ SE TH@@ EN THE O@@ TH@@ ERS .
<n> Electri@@ c pump failed : T@@ ook it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and ble@@ w .
<n> It was a painful job .
<n> Is loo@@ sing air with AL@@ M@@ OS@@ T NO USE !@@ !
<n> No way !
<n> Batter@@ ies run out or lose power after 3 - 4 uses .
<n> Second , it hur@@ ts your cli@@ tor@@ is .
<n> A@@ w@@ ful : This was much bigger then I had anticipated , that being my own fault .
<n> But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it h@@ urt !
<n> The b@@ unny for my cli@@ t ir@@ rit@@ ated it and was not one bit pleas@@ ur@@ able .
<n> So my man suggested I turn it around and then my tain@@ t became ir@@ rit@@ ated !
<n> Not one bit pleased with this product .
<n> I can sort sli@@ p it inside but its tight and not very comfortable .
<n> A@@ w@@ ful !
<n> H@@ ATE IT !
<n> Let me tell you , I was NOT IM@@ PR@@ ES@@ SE@@ D !
<n> What a waste !
<n> S@@ lick Looking - Comp@@ on@@ ents are older technology - Key@@ board su@@ cks !
<n> Con@@ f@@ used : I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter .
<n> O@@ h Rom@@ eo : St@@ up@@ id teen@@ agers .
<n> And poor communication .
<n> The layout is ug@@ ly .
<n> So here goes : Kev@@ in Sor@@ bo , while delivering a truly pa@@ thetic performance -- I swe@@ ar !
<n> So ..@@ .... a lost sale for this company .
<n> Dis@@ appointed !
<n> It fails mis@@ er@@ ably there !
<n> MAN@@ S@@ ON H@@ AT@@ ES EM@@ M@@ ON@@ S .
<n> The author betra@@ yed Char@@ lie by pret@@ ending to be his &apos; friend &apos;@@ .
<n> Every@@ body distor@@ ts everything he has ever said .
<n> Stru@@ gg@@ led Through !
<n> : I stru@@ gg@@ led through this book .
<n> The stor@@ y@@ line was a b@@ ore !
<n> I was also anx@@ ious to read this book as it was highly recommended , but too was I disappointed .
<n> This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of to@@ y buying .
<n> However , this is by far the worst to@@ y we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years .
<n> If you are considering purchasing it ... don &apos; t ... you &apos; ll save your self some money and fru@@ stration .
<n> Wor@@ st scanner I &apos; ve owned .
<n> : I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year .
<n> The picture quality is hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> Compl@@ ete and utter waste of my time .
<n> Po@@ or substitute for an iPod : Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod .
<n> Yet another broken head@@ phone jack .
<n> : After roughly a year of fairly reliable use , I &apos; ve also fallen pre@@ y to the f@@ aul@@ ty head@@ phone jack .
<n> Not very well written due to being too wor@@ dy , hard to follow .
<n> What a waste of time and money .
<n> I think this book is a must read for people stru@@ ggling with rit@@ ual abuse !
<n> Th@@ ats where trouble came .
<n> I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player .
<n> Wor@@ st mp@@ 3 player on the market .
<n> This is about the worst mp@@ 3 player on the market .
<n> I cannot create or save any play@@ lists .
<n> The worst aspect of this player is the battery life .
<n> Also the menus can be a bit s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish .
<n> Wor@@ th@@ less .
<n> Fo@@ und the language a bit much to wa@@ de through a second time , and not as f@@ unny .
<n> What a waste : Compl@@ ete waste of $ 12 . 00 .
<n> The J@@ ab@@ ra E@@ ar G@@ els are an absolute waste .
<n> So this product fails and had I &apos; d seen them in person I w@@ ouldn &apos; t have spent my money on them .
<n> Un@@ fot@@ un@@ ately after a few days they started rej@@ ecting my head@@ set .
<n> It was us@@ eless .
<n> Everything was hor@@ ri@@ ble to my opinion .
<n> So two stars for two stars thrown by ug@@ ly T
<n> Very B@@ OR@@ ING : This movie was very bo@@ aring .
<n> I really did@@ nt enjoy it at all .
<n> I just don@@ t enjoy when people kill .
<n> I really don@@ t enjoy things like that others might .
<n> The white wh@@ ale isn &apos; t : The anni@@ mation for the white wh@@ ale was l@@ ous@@ y .
<n> The attempt to give under@@ water scenes with the white wh@@ ale sending the ship to the bottom st@@ unk .
<n> Wa@@ ste of time and money : I have used this product in addition to the f@@ og@@ ger and car@@ pet powder .
<n> It is a major waste of time and money .
<n> This movie is an absolute ins@@ ult !
<n> It would have be a waste of electricity and my V@@ CR .
<n> Exc@@ ept worse !
<n> very much disappointed : It was just terrible for me , living in Italy for many years now .
<n> I h@@ ated to see exagger@@ ated ster@@ e@@ otyp@@ ing of Italian men .
<n> it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View .
<n> What a disappointing story ! The story had no sense of direction .
<n> All in all , the story turned out to be pretty stup@@ id with nothing to admire in the main character .
<n> under the Tuscany Sun : Was Very Very disappointed !@@ !
<n> Way way too much PC ma@@ dness . A waste of time and money .
<n> A failure of &quot; B@@ att@@ le@@ field Earth &quot; propor@@ tions !
<n> : I should say , &quot; worse than B@@ att@@ le@@ field Earth propor@@ tions !@@ &quot;
<n> TER@@ R@@ IB@@ LE MO@@ VI@@ E !
<n> : This movie was one of the worst films I &apos; ve seen in years .
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> For Y@@ u - G@@ i - O@@ h fans , you should try buying Y@@ u - G@@ i - O@@ h t@@ ins instead of this C@@ RA@@ P !
<n> don@@ t get it : D@@ ont get it the graphics su@@ ck and u can only get m@@ ega man .
<n> Not a good to@@ y : This to@@ y isn &apos; t well made or designed with kids in mind .
<n> The characters are bor@@ ing and flat .
<n> His hum@@ or is down@@ right stup@@ id .
<n> This book is not cle@@ ver in the least .
<n> B@@ oring plot .
<n> What I didn &apos; t like was the plot , it just bor@@ ed me .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> I suffered the un@@ due consequences of going off &quot; cold tur@@ key &quot; when I needed to t@@ aper off .
<n> ! If you want the facts ( as bor@@ ing as they are ) -- don@@ t rely on this book .
<n> I was wrong .
<n> Why didn &apos; t we know of Mrs . Bo@@ under@@ b@@ ys inner tur@@ mo@@ il till she ran to her father ?
<n> My son carries it around as a pro@@ p but it too difficult for a child between 6 - 10 to understand .
<n> Ki@@ ds can battle each other .
<n> No way . It isn &apos; t that great outdoor neither .
<n> Very disappointing .
<n> static central : Audio play@@ back through this extension is terrible -- constant static .
<n> Fre@@ ud is cra@@ zy !
<n> Ama@@ zon . com sent wrong size : Ama@@ zon . com sent the wrong size engine oil cool@@ er than what I ordered .
<n> It &apos; s still makes me highly ag@@ it@@ ated every time I think about it .
<n> It has the worst ending ever !
<n> It still p@@ is@@ ses me off that I spent the time reading it .
<n> AS@@ IDE : DO NOT RE@@ AD IF YOU ARE S@@ EN@@ S@@ IT@@ IVE TO RA@@ PE !
<n> I am always a su@@ cker for a re@@ master , so decided what the h@@ eck .
<n> No drawings !
<n> Old - School B@@ ore Metal : This album offers nothing new or exciting to the gen@@ re of metal .
<n> Just dum@@ b , dum@@ b , dum@@ b .
<n> Do not order from R@@ itz Cam@@ era - wrong item : Do not order this item and expect to get what you see .
<n> Fl@@ y@@ boys : Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong .
<n> In execution , it is a disappointment .
<n> S@@ app@@ y and St@@ up@@ id : This is a very bad movie .
<n> Bad music , bad acting , bad special effects .
<n> getting tired of the c@@ liche : Just another one of those movies .
<n> later on his album came along , his voc@@ als destroy his tracks , literally .
<n> Dis@@ appointing .
<n> ra@@ y@@ di@@ ation : Thank God he stopped ra@@ pping , but now this album su@@ cks too !
<n> He &apos; s re@@ pp@@ in &apos; Cal@@ i too - oh hell no !
<n> Ex@@ as@@ per@@ ating and anno@@ ying .
<n> But after a half do@@ zen chapters , I still couldn &apos; t care less about T@@ im .
<n> For better writing and deeper analysis about the 96 tragedy , stick to the other 2 books .
<n> : This book is a total waste of time to read .
<n> G@@ amm@@ el@@ ga@@ ard is so into herself it makes me sick .
<n> If you &apos; re not familiar with this band , this probably w@@ ouldn &apos; t be the best album to start with .
<n> terrible : Un@@ able to use on my television .
<n> 1984 : 1984 over all is a very bor@@ ing book .
<n> George had a good idea but the book really st@@ unk .
<n> I h@@ ated the book so much that I for@@ got her name .
<n> It is twice as worse as 1984 .
<n> If you want an un@@ realistic view of a future that is totally mor@@ bid and de@@ pressing , check this out .
<n> 1984 : I thought it was a very d@@ ull and che@@ es@@ y book .
<n> I won &apos; t comment on the light , since I wasn &apos; t interested it that option .
<n> :@@ \@@ : If I could give this a negative rating I would .
<n> Wa@@ ste of money : I bought this for our first long trip with the baby .
<n> It was a waste of money and time .
<n> a bor@@ ing bloo@@ dy m@@ ess .
<n> : shame on me for buying it .
<n> shame on me for reading it .
<n> I H@@ ATE TH@@ IS BO@@ OK : I thought this was the worst book I ever read .
<n> There was no point and way to conf@@ using .
<n> i h@@ ated reading this !
<n> This book is very difficult to read .
<n> Di@@ d@@ n &apos; t Like it !@@ !
<n> : Con@@ f@@ using , distur@@ bing , and stup@@ id are some of the few words to use when descri@@ bing this book .
<n> Ray Bra@@ d@@ bury reads it , and it is very bad .
<n> It was so painful to listen to his voice I had to turn it off .
<n> It deserves negative 1000 stars .
<n> This was the W@@ OR@@ ST book I have ever read .
<n> The book moved to slow , and the characters are stup@@ id .
<n> Gu@@ y Montag , the main character , is a fire@@ man who sets books on fire , bec@@ u@@ ase homes are fire@@ proof .
<n> Har@@ dly even deserves 1 star : This is definitely one of the W@@ OR@@ ST books I have ever come across .
<n> I almost fell as@@ le@@ ep during the for@@ word , I don@@ t know how I survi@@ ved the book .
<n> The book dra@@ gs on and one at a pain@@ fully slow pace .
<n> Ble@@ ak , Bl@@ ind , and B@@ oring .
<n> : Being forced to read it in school for its &quot; so called &quot; relation to cens@@ or@@ ship ( sp ?@@ )
<n> Al@@ thou@@ gh@@ the book is about cens@@ or@@ ship and why / how it is wrong I can &apos; t say much good about it .
<n> First off , everyone in the country is an idi@@ ot .
<n> As I read this book , I got more and more confused .
<n> S@@ adly a disappointment : Perhaps it is dated .
<n> poor reading : I bought this book on tape as read by the author .
<n> It is exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating to listen to .
<n> I have no i@@ des@@ a just how in the world a book this hor@@ ri@@ ble could have stayed around for 40 years !@@ !@@ !
<n> I have talked to everyone I know and they all read the first 5 pages and im@@ me@@ adi@@ at@@ ly h@@ ated it .
<n> After reading the first few pages I was completely lost .
<n> Bra@@ d@@ bury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem sc@@ ary and un@@ realistic .
<n> Defin@@ et@@ ly not the greatest book in the world .
<n> Person@@ ally , I h@@ ated the book .
<n> W@@ AS@@ TE OF M@@ Y T@@ IM@@ E : first of all i was assigned to read this book for a class .
<n> it started out l@@ ame .
<n> and all it did was get worse .
<n> This is the lam@@ est book I have ever read : This book really su@@ cks .
<n> It makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time .
<n> Wei@@ rd Wei@@ rd Wei@@ rd Wei@@ rd !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> : This book started out wei@@ rd and ended up wi@@ er@@ d and bor@@ ing !
<n> It just stopped , I gu@@ ess to end the bor@@ ed@@ om .
<n> Not so good : It works .
<n> So no , this was not a good purchase , and I do not trust the source .
<n> battle we@@ ary : This game is hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> The batt@@ les are so ... long , slow and un@@ exciting .
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble Game : This game is bor@@ ing .
<n> The fight scenes take too long and they are also bor@@ ing .
<n> I@@ ve played all three and the Fel@@ low@@ ship is by far the worst game i have !
<n> DO NOT B@@ U@@ Y TH@@ IS IT@@ S A W@@ AS@@ TE OF M@@ ON@@ E@@ Y !@@ !@@ !
<n> After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing .
<n> The secondary characters problems just brought the book down further .
<n> NO AV@@ A@@ I@@ LA@@ BIL@@ ITY : My rating is for Ama@@ zon , not the product .
<n> Very disappointing
<n> War@@ ning .
<n> I H@@ IG@@ H@@ L@@ Y don &apos; t recommend this set !
<n> If they did , they would correctly assume that I am , in fact , a p@@ omp@@ ous er@@ u@@ di@@ te f@@ ool .
<n> But gu@@ ess what ?@@ -- I don &apos; t care and I &apos; ll never actually read any of your responses .
<n> Why ? What the hell is going on with Finn@@ eg@@ ans W@@ ake ?@@ ?@@ ?
<n> Unfortunately , the rest of the film is nothing more that a s@@ no@@ o@@ z@@ ef@@ est ri@@ po@@ ff of other war movies .
<n> I tried cont@@ acting them , but no response .
<n> S@@ ad , since I was looking forward to reading this , based on the jack@@ et copy .
<n> At the end of the movie your left wonder@@ ing why you bo@@ ther@@ ed to even watch the first two thirds .
<n> Dis@@ appointing : This was a very disappointing purchase .
<n> Absol@@ ute Cra@@ p !
<n> A Tru@@ ley Hor@@ ri@@ ble Hor@@ ror Film : A truly hor@@ ri@@ ble hor@@ ror film .
<n> Ca@@ ther@@ ine Z@@ eta - Jones tra@@ p !
<n> : Is &quot; The House On Ha@@ un@@ ted Hill &quot; so different than &quot; The Ha@@ unting &@@ quot@@ ;@@ ?
<n> ... and what a fe@@ eb@@ le ha@@ unting it is !
<n> : No , no , no !
<n> What went wrong ?
<n> L@@ ili Tay@@ lor and O@@ wen Wil@@ son also try to add flav@@ our to it all , but cannot manage to save the day .
<n> And the e@@ erie mood is almost totally ab@@ sent .
<n> Not a good omen for a &quot; hor@@ ror &quot; movie , is it ? I just can &apos; t believe what went wrong for Ne@@ es@@ on .
<n> : S@@ ad S@@ ad Sad@@ The waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs .
<n> H@@ es a great actor , but was very weak in this movie .
<n> There was maybe one sc@@ ary part , which was when a f@@ ake lo@@ ok@@ in sk@@ el@@ et@@ on p@@ opp@@ ed up and made me jump .
<n> I don@@ t recommend this movie to people who like sc@@ ary movies , b / c it was a pol@@ ar opposite .
<n> It was worse .
<n> They &apos; re just anno@@ ying .
<n> Z@@ eta - Jones &apos; s leather hi@@ p@@ bo@@ ots manage to out - act her , and L@@ ili Tay@@ lor is hil@@ ari@@ ously bad as Ele@@ an@@ or .
<n> Li@@ am Ne@@ es@@ on is even less interesting than he was in THE PH@@ AN@@ TO@@ M M@@ EN@@ ACE , if that &apos; s possible .
<n> Sh@@ ame on me .
<n> EM@@ B@@ AR@@ ASS@@ ING@@ L@@ Y B@@ AD : This is the worst film of all time .
<n> S@@ adly Dis@@ appointing : This over@@ done re@@ make of the brilliant 1963 classic is sor@@ ely disappointing .
<n> If you want some innovative hor@@ ror from 1999 , I suggest you get &quot; The Blair Wit@@ ch Project &@@ quot@@ ;@@ .
<n> I wanted to use it for a w@@ k@@ end trip I was taking and was sho@@ cked at how small the bag was .
<n> The card works fine on my PC , but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam .
<n> Too B@@ oring to Continu@@ e : I only made it to 19@@ 5 pages .
<n> The book is just bor@@ ing .
<n> A lot of sound and fur@@ y signi@@ fying very little .
<n> B@@ UT -- I don &apos; t care about the characters .
<n> If you don &apos; t care about the characters , then all their qu@@ ir@@ ky f@@ aults seem abstra@@ ct and d@@ ull .
<n> Why not just say that difficult and conf@@ using books are not very good .
<n> I found myself growing more de@@ pressed and dis@@ gu@@ sted with every page .
<n> Could never read this book ....@@ : This is what I think my problem is ...
<n> I &apos; ll second that : I nearly cri@@ ed when I realized that this was an abri@@ dged version .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble product , did not work , and company un@@ reach@@ able .
<n> I followed all the terrible instructions , and it still did not work .
<n> It is the second of three items purchased from Ama@@ zon , and a second disappointment .
<n> Does anyone know if this an inherent problem with all the press@@ ings ?
<n> Per@@ ab@@ o &apos; s acting was so anno@@ ying , she ru@@ ined the whole movie for me .
<n> Her fear of singing in public just became more and more ir@@ rit@@ ating as the movie proceed@@ ed .
<n> I just wanted to sm@@ ack her and say just do it and stop your wh@@ ining and s@@ ni@@ vel@@ ing !
<n> Co@@ yo@@ te St@@ up@@ id : This movie is so dum@@ b ... &quot; HO@@ W D@@ U@@ MB IS IT ?@@ &quot;
<n> D@@ um@@ b , D@@ um@@ b , D@@ U@@ MB . Did I mention that it st@@ unk too .
<n> Absol@@ utely hor@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> What a waste of my time !
<n> &@@ quot@@ ;@@ : This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type .
<n> If you don &apos; t know y@@ oga , it &apos; s us@@ eless .
<n> Y@@ oga is great for surfing , but this is a poor video .
<n> But when the music started , he was very un@@ happy !@@ !
<n> The mel@@ ody and pace are different - and the perform@@ ers aren &apos; t interesting .
<n> bad acting : This movie had bad acting .
<n> Enter@@ taining , but fre@@ ak@@ y : My son wanted this video so we got it .
<n> There is a danger in making things that children think are RE@@ AL .
<n> I found this book to be lack lu@@ ster and bor@@ ing .
<n> Wor@@ st test pre@@ p book I have ever used .
<n> : As other re@@ vie@@ wers have suggested , this book is F@@ UL@@ L of errors .
<n> Which of course defe@@ ats the purpose of a study guide .
<n> Some of the equ@@ ations ( even the Hen@@ der@@ son - Has@@ selb@@ al@@ ch ) they provide are wrong .
<n> There is even a convenient example worked out with an er@@ ron@@ e@@ ous equ@@ ation .
<n> Ne@@ ed@@ less to say he was very disappointed as was I .
<n> Does not appear to be very dur@@ able or we just got a bad one .
<n> Not too much fun there .
<n> I feel I wast@@ ed my money .
<n> Very disappointing .
<n> Which means I can &apos; t enjoy it :@@ ( I was a bit frustr@@ ated .
<n> Tal@@ k about l@@ ous@@ y merchan@@ dis@@ ing .
<n> Mess@@ y .
<n> Po@@ or example .
<n> Mis@@ leading title : A book with a heavily religious sl@@ ant .
<n> Sh@@ ame on you for writing such a book and calling yourself a coun@@ sel@@ or .
<n> Did anyone else encounter this problem or did I just get a bad DVD .
<n> : My fault .
<n> It was a bad impul@@ se buy for me .
<n> Some parts are interesting and maybe even susp@@ ens@@ ful , but the rest is kind of d@@ ull .
<n> A@@ verage Book : The book wasn &apos; t as great as the reviews said it was .
<n> Some one has an EG@@ O problem .
<n> : I previously wrote a sc@@ a@@ thing review of this bad book .
<n> I &apos; m not sure who it was . I still maintain that the be@@ ek is B@@ AD .
<n> M@@ IS@@ S@@ ING T@@ EX@@ T !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> Dis@@ appointing : I got this video on loan from Net@@ fli@@ x .
<n> As a rail@@ fan , I was extremely disappointed in this .
<n> The show was nothing like I had anticipated it being like .
<n> And the host is just plain anno@@ ying trying to em@@ ulate Em@@ eri@@ l Lag@@ asse
<n> Not as good as the other album !
<n> However , I was a bit dis@@ a@@ pointed be@@ ac@@ ause it was so inf@@ erior compared to I thought about you .
<n> In a word ..@@ .@@ : painful .
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> I rarely H@@ ATE a movie but this bank@@ rupt , purely per@@ ver@@ ted film is just A@@ W@@ F@@ U@@ L .
<n> U@@ sel@@ ess : The DVD will not play .
<n> It is hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> I was embar@@ rass@@ ed for the film@@ makers .
<n> A@@ w@@ ful Wa@@ ste of Money !
<n> It is too bad the rating system does not have a choice of zero or negative stars .
<n> movie was a waste of money : this movie totally su@@ cks .
<n> i only spent 13 dollars on it and i still think i wast@@ ed my money .
<n> the mon@@ sters were so f@@ ake and it took like an hour before anything happened .
<n> the only cool part was at the beg@@ ining when that guy died from that pole .
<n> th@@ ats it , the movie su@@ cked don@@ t buy it .
<n> The act@@ res@@ ses were very bad at acting , and not in that cool b - hor@@ ror movie way either , they su@@ ck .
<n> over rated : had been given such a write up on this - disappointing to say the least .
<n> No sho@@ cks - highly predictable - and with a theme that has been done to death !
<n> har@@ ass@@ ing bears ?
<n> C@@ ole has been c@@ ited for har@@ ass@@ ing bear in Y@@ el@@ low@@ stone National Park .
<n> Gri@@ zz@@ lies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states .
<n> Vista has been in bet@@ a for a long time , so I find this delay to be in@@ exc@@ usable .
<n> The instructions say that the pipe can be up to 2 - 3 / 4 &quot; long , but actually this is wrong .
<n> Sh@@ ame on you , Mr Coff@@ ee !
<n> Wor@@ th@@ less Pi@@ ece of Cra@@ p !
<n> : This thing needs a High M@@ ed Low setting cause the only setting it has is Low .
<n> A Wor@@ th@@ less piece of Cra@@ p .
<n> Not happy with this one !
<n> Very disappointed .
<n> Dis@@ appointed : I am very disappointed in the Mr . coffee cup war@@ mer .
<n> I can &apos; t stand lu@@ ke warm coffee so it is us@@ eless in my opinion .
<n> Unfortunately , I cannot offer advice on what others because I have not found a good one yet .
<n> Lor@@ ain@@ ne Ko@@ var &apos; s books are G@@ RO@@ SS@@ L@@ Y O@@ VER@@ PR@@ IC@@ ED and still do not do the job they should .
<n> I will have to dri@@ ll my own holes to remedy this problem .
<n> VER@@ Y UN@@ HA@@ PP@@ Y .
<n> Too bad Gal@@ bra@@ i@@ th isn &apos; t much of an econom@@ ist .
<n> The return policy should cover this type of problem and refund 100 % in those cases .
<n> it came with the case broken and two disc@@ s will not play all the way through .
<n> So now I &apos; m reluc@@ tant to buy Blu rays .
<n> I regret getting a Blu ray player at all now .
<n> TH@@ E@@ Y LE@@ A@@ K - Use SW@@ AD@@ DL@@ ERS !@@ !@@ !
<n> We bought Hu@@ g@@ gi@@ es for night time or n@@ aps . Very disappointing .
<n> W@@ eren &apos; t So Great .
<n> H@@ ated them .
<n> I swe@@ ar by P@@ amp@@ ers ! But , even though they are less expensive , the Baby Dry type are not worth it !
<n> Wor@@ st E@@ ver !@@ !
<n> I was very frustr@@ ated .
<n> No le@@ aking and no washing of clothes any more !@@ !
<n> Not as good as Hu@@ g@@ gi@@ es S@@ nu@@ g & Dry : When my son wher@@ es P@@ amp@@ ers , the po@@ op always ri@@ des up his back .
<n> I &apos; ve never had this problem with Sw@@ add@@ lers or Hu@@ g@@ gi@@ es , so I know it &apos; s not the operator .
<n> What a waste !
<n> They le@@ ak if you forget to change a di@@ aper before the baby sle@@ eps .
<n> We are sending these back as def@@ ective and ordering more sw@@ add@@ lers .
<n> when it comes to change her di@@ aper i was really sho@@ cked .
<n> her but@@ t and all the di@@ aper area was in terrible red color and she had the worst ras@@ h so far .
<n> I was wrong .
<n> Not as good as Cru@@ is@@ ers : I normally buy P@@ amp@@ ers Cru@@ is@@ ers , I will not buy these again .
<n> The sw@@ add@@ lers didn &apos; t have good protection and he would po@@ op out of them .
<n> They are aw@@ ful every di@@ aper he either pe@@ es or po@@ ops out of .
<n> I am really not happy with Baby Dry .
<n> However , when the box arrived the di@@ apers sm@@ elled A@@ W@@ F@@ U@@ L -- chemical - like .
<n> P@@ amp@@ ers : These p@@ amp@@ ers were the worst , my son was so@@ aked .
<n> I have almost an entire case of these that I am don@@ ating because I don &apos; t trust them .
<n> Le@@ ak with bre@@ ast@@ feed po@@ op up the back !
<n> Then got to waste time and change her shirt with po@@ op and whatever else the po@@ op got on !
<n> An@@ no@@ ying !
<n> A M@@ ist@@ ake : A co - worker gave this book to me .
<n> I now regret ever having read this sil@@ ly book and am planning on burning it .
<n> Sh@@ am@@ eful : In my opinion , this d@@ v@@ d did not contain any worth while figure sk@@ ating coverage .
<n> My five year old was in TE@@ AR@@ S because we could only find five second cli@@ ps of actual sk@@ ating .
<n> SH@@ AM@@ E ON YOU N@@ BC .
<n> The mar@@ ti@@ al arts were &quot; ok &quot; in this , but nothing I ha@@ vent seen done better before .
<n> There is NO center channel on the multi channel layer .
<n> If you are serious about multi channel recordings this is the worst ...
<n> bad power su@@ pl@@ ly : i bought this 18 months ago .
<n> Many people have experienced this problem with the ps
<n> General Over@@ view of B@@ iz@@ ar@@ re C@@ ases , too ob@@ t@@ use for crime schol@@ ars .
<n> PO@@ OR QU@@ AL@@ ITY : This is a very poor quality nec@@ kl@@ ace .
<n> No bill in the box , so s@@ adly , I am unable to return .
<n> Re@@ ally B@@ AD : The product was in a very old box and the AC / DC connection was just a bare wire .
<n> TH@@ IS IS VER@@ Y FR@@ US@@ TR@@ AT@@ ING AS I F@@ E@@ EL I &apos; VE SP@@ ENT M@@ Y H@@ AR@@ D E@@ AR@@ NE@@ D M@@ ON@@ E@@ Y ON TH@@ IS . TH@@ AN@@ KS FOR NO@@ TH@@ ING !@@ !@@ !
<n> Not pleased : I am not very pleased with this product for a couple reasons .
<n> He suff@@ ers par@@ aly@@ zed in a hospital bed and dies .
<n> There is nothing useful after that point and there is a LO@@ T of over@@ acting .
<n> Def@@ ective Machine - Don &apos; t buy !
<n> I thought maybe I had a bad machine , so I took it back to the store and ex@@ changed it for a new one .
<n> A month later , same problem !
<n> Phone Co@@ ver : Not the greatest produce .
<n> I just haven &apos; t really been pleased with it .
<n> The V@@ CR is noisy - very di@@ stra@@ c@@ ting .
<n> Compl@@ ete F@@ ail@@ ure : This Album Off@@ ers Absol@@ utely Nothing Wor@@ th W@@ asting Time With .
<n> Dis@@ sa@@ pointed : I am so disappointed with the E@@ e@@ be@@ e DVD .
<n> It was a waste of money for my 2 year old
<n> However the plot was aw@@ ful .
<n> SD@@ RE has lost their style and emo@@ tion .
<n> The book should be called &quot; Bad writing lessons .@@ &quot;
<n> However if it is not as enjoyable as the Vi@@ val@@ di , why would I spend money to listen to Monter@@ o ?
<n> the company cont@@ acted to advise of this mistake .
<n> A few minutes of hor@@ ror : There &apos; s about 15 minutes of hor@@ ror film .
<n> Instead it was dre@@ ary .
<n> The acting , even by J@@ un J@@ i Hy@@ un , was dre@@ ary .
<n> The actions by the characters were dre@@ ary .
<n> I was totally che@@ ated .
<n> That way , no customer would ever have to be fo@@ ol@@ ed again .
<n> : Gi@@ ve it up everyone , R@@ amm@@ stein is dead .
<n> ( p@@ 103 ) This struck me as rather comp@@ as@@ sion@@ less , especially for a book about par@@ enting .
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> Wa@@ ste of $@@ $@@ $@@ $@@ .
<n> Su@@ cked .
<n> waste of paper and money !
<n> It arrived damaged .
<n> I was very dis@@ cour@@ aged about the idea of ordering again .
<n> Although some apparently disagree , not a good choice for anyone over four years old .
<n> Very disappointed : This arrived in a different package and bottle than shown .
<n> It also has a n@@ asty , dirty spot where some sort of sti@@ cker was removed .
<n> That was a couple of hundred dollars wast@@ ed .
<n> Now i get paper j@@ am war@@ nings when there is no paper in the bloo@@ dy machine .
<n> I had trouble installing it even though I work in IT .
<n> Who Fr@@ amed Rog@@ er Rab@@ bit : I bought this movie new , but it will not play on my D@@ v@@ D player .
<n> I am very disappointed with this product .
<n> I@@ d@@ k : It doesn &apos; t play in normal DVD players .
<n> One of the worst movies ever made !
<n> Come on , this movie has hor@@ ri@@ ble acting , a d@@ read@@ fully bad story and &quot; hil@@ ari@@ ously &quot; un@@ f@@ unny j@@ ok@@ es .
<n> I had high hope for this movie , but boy what a waste of time this was .
<n> But still , this blan@@ ket statement about the power of thought really bo@@ ther@@ ed me .
<n> I would not have ordered this had I know it was coming from England & that I might have a problem
<n> DO NOT B@@ U@@ Y until the problem is fixed ... you &apos; ll just have to send them back .
<n> Fig@@ ured they were old reviews and had fixed the problems .
<n> Very disappointed in that they are still selling this def@@ ective disk .
<n> Not the real thing : I couldn &apos; t believe my eyes when I saw the amaz@@ ingly low price for this product .
<n> N@@ ever got the faster speed but it worked fine for 2 1 / 2 years and died suddenly .
<n> S@@ no@@ o@@ z - a - pa - loo@@ za : Total waste of cell@@ u@@ lo@@ id , not to mention time , money etc .
<n> Not enter@@ taining at all .
<n> Not creative at all .
<n> Absol@@ utely nothing happens in this ill attempt at making something pro@@ voc@@ ative .
<n> hor@@ ri@@ ble !@@ !@@ !
<n> b@@ ummer and I had to pull myself through it !@@ !
<n> I really c@@ ant understand why we c@@ ant just leave him alone !@@ !
<n> Kur@@ t &apos; s probably turning in his grave over this .
<n> All in all take my word for it , this is a waste of money and time !
<n> What a waste !
<n> Le@@ ave it to this jack@@ ass who sold out to everything Kur@@ t C@@ ob@@ ain wasn &apos; t .
<n> What a waste , another person selling out to the all mi@@ ghty dollar trying to make his film career .
<n> I was very s@@ ad@@ dened by how dis@@ sa@@ pointing it turned out to be .
<n> Di@@ ff@@ icul@@ t Read : This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far .
<n> I have read and r@@ er@@ ead the story , but still have difficulty summ@@ ari@@ zing the story .
<n> The exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ingly long paragraphs are what makes it so difficult to follow .
<n> Not true .
<n> Sh@@ ame !
<n> Exp@@ ected more ..@@ .@@ : not as good as Cel@@ tic W@@ om@@ an or Han@@ ley West@@ en@@ ra ...
<n> I would say not half good .
<n> U@@ sel@@ ess for Home theatre or TV show .
<n> W@@ r@@ ong size : I have no idea how good or bad this item is .
<n> I like this artists music , but was not too thri@@ ll@@ ed with this CD .
<n> If you &apos; re good looking for Stein@@ beck , I suggest the &quot; Rap@@ es of W@@ ra@@ th .@@ &quot;
<n> don &apos; t read this book : When I started reading the book at school I found it bor@@ ing .
<n> but the theme doesn &apos; t make it a pleasure to read .
<n> They have a dream but it &apos; s very difficult for them to make it true because of Le@@ en@@ ie &apos; s du@@ mb@@ ness .
<n> When they &apos; re working in ran@@ ch problems happens because of Le@@ en@@ ie .
<n> It was the worst thing ever .
<n> I feel as@@ le@@ ep every day he read it because it was so bor@@ ing !
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble cam@@ era@@ work and spot@@ ty acting over - all .
<n> Bad editing and anno@@ ying Cal@@ i pop - pun@@ k sound@@ track , only saved by the presence of Qu@@ asi .
<n> Bo@@ y was I wrong !
<n> Bad , Bad , stup@@ id , poor writing , acting , fil@@ ming , generally it su@@ cked !
<n> His voice is good enough , but his music is just so cor@@ ny and bor@@ ing .
<n> He said people are tired of f@@ ake pop stars .
<n> Person@@ ally I think he is a dis@@ grace to the North Carol@@ ina name .
<n> Cra@@ w@@ ling under a rock to spare my ears the ag@@ ony ....@@ .@@ : U@@ gh !
<n> I just think that this c@@ d has some cra@@ pp@@ y songs with cra@@ pp@@ y ly@@ rics .
<n> When a good voice meets bad music : This album is a complete waste of C@@ lay &apos; s voice .
<n> All I can say is it remin@@ ds me of a water@@ ed down mix of bad Air Supp@@ ly meets bad Bar@@ ry Mani@@ low .
<n> It hur@@ ts : It hur@@ ts to see C@@ lay fall like this .
<n> Unfortunately on this CD C@@ lay is over@@ powered by background sing@@ ers .
<n> It lacks any lu@@ ster and will probably get lost in a pi@@ le of old CD &apos; s .
<n> I think it &apos; s aw@@ ful with the exception of two tracks - &quot; Meas@@ ure of A Man &quot; and &quot; This is the Night &@@ quot@@ ;@@ .
<n> The background music is far too loud and dro@@ w@@ ns out C@@ lay most of the time .
<n> Why I H@@ ate Pot@@ ato Chi@@ ps : Ac@@ tually I love Pot@@ ato Chi@@ ps ... this just plain S@@ UC@@ KS .
<n> What is wrong with you people ?@@ !
<n> And this guy sup@@ pos@@ el@@ dy fre@@ ak@@ in &apos; L@@ OS@@ T !
<n> There &apos; s something wrong here fol@@ ks .
<n> This album deserves N@@ EG@@ AT@@ IVE 10 ST@@ AR@@ S !
<n> : Why would any lu@@ ci@@ d human being waste their money buying this j@@ unk ?
<n> He &apos; s destroying those classi@@ cs with his &quot; broad@@ w@@ ay@@ esque &quot; voice .
<n> I am a huge fan of C@@ lay &apos; s , but was very disappointed with this CD .
<n> Big disappointment !@@ !@@ !
<n> : B@@ ought it and was a bit disappointed .
<n> girls are cra@@ zy over him !@@ !
<n> Te@@ en Titan Tower falls apart : This to@@ y is absolutely terrible .
<n> Even a four year old can see how l@@ ame this to@@ y is .
<n> IT &apos; S TER@@ R@@ IB@@ LE !@@ !
<n> This book is just an en@@ cy@@ cl@@ op@@ edia of waste .
<n> It is a very frustr@@ ating read because there are absolutely no examples .
<n> Car Par@@ ts ( stru@@ ts ) for [@@ ] Java [@@ ]@@ ..@@ .@@ : This book is a complete waste of time .
<n> Re@@ ally bad style .
<n> Through the Mad@@ ness !@@ !@@ !
<n> Temperat@@ ure displayed is incorrect : The accuracy of this ther@@ mom@@ eter is really poor .
<n> The replacement has same problem I did cali@@ br@@ ate it , still it shows wrong temperature .
<n> : The new Resi@@ dent E@@ vi@@ l Out@@ break is bor@@ ing .
<n> I expected it to be action - packed , boy was I wrong .
<n> The Wor@@ st of Kirk W@@ hal@@ um : Kirk W@@ hal@@ um is a fantastic sa@@ x@@ op@@ hon@@ ist but this one is a disaster !@@ !
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble product : This shirt is absolutely the worst in the market .
<n> A cl@@ as - sick that made me sick : This book was very bor@@ ing .
<n> A disappointing read for the 21st century : This book is a classic .
<n> But I found it a rather bor@@ ing and dru@@ dging read .
<n> A real m@@ ess .
<n> There were batt@@ les that never took place .
<n> In fact , fighting was the main focus of this movie .
<n> Any@@ thing that had any hin@@ t of spiritu@@ ality was ob@@ liter@@ ated from the movie .
<n> One of the worst mountain@@ e@@ ering books I have ever read .
<n> It leaves a terrible white resi@@ due that takes forever to ru@@ b in . Maybe because of the high SP@@ F ?
<n> I am not sure , but I was definitely disappointed .
<n> Is@@ n &apos; t worth my time and fru@@ stration to send it back .
<n> A waste of money -- and tin .
<n> Mis@@ leading : You get what you pay for with this set .
<n> One full DVD is the l@@ ame three st@@ oo@@ ges car@@ to@@ ons .
<n> But al@@ as - Cur@@ ly is not easily found in this comp@@ ilation .
<n> Also - a lot of the &quot; extra features &quot; are l@@ ame .
<n> The rest of the set is cra@@ p .
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ bly Dis@@ appointed !
<n> it seem to be cru@@ de and it &apos; s really a book for girls only .
<n> B@@ OR@@ ING : I have never read a book that was so bor@@ ing .
<n> I didn &apos; t like the character of Pat@@ ty , she seemed so pa@@ thetic and she wh@@ ined too much .
<n> The book distur@@ bed me .
<n> However , the zi@@ pp@@ ers are done in very low end quality .
<n> and the zi@@ pp@@ ers are terrible always get caught . its ro@@ om@@ y but its cheap !
<n> Despite the packaging , however , the fundamental basis for his theory is fat@@ ally f@@ law@@ ed .
<n> There are EV@@ ID@@ ENT growing ER@@ RO@@ RS in this book .
<n> bor@@ ing & pre@@ ten@@ tious cra@@ p !
<n> We read selected chapters of the book . They writing was hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> Instead , he comes off as bor@@ ing and pre@@ ten@@ tious . Ski@@ p this book ... try something else .
<n> El@@ ton John &apos; s du@@ et with Rand@@ y New@@ man just isn &apos; t as much fun .
<n> I was just disappointed .
<n> the songs lost the fla@@ vor i was looking for .
<n> Dis@@ appointed in that !
<n> Their life & times , trials & st@@ am@@ ina through the Depression , war ( s )@@ , and raising families .
<n> As it is , Bro@@ ka@@ w c@@ ann@@ on@@ iz@@ es his subjects and does a poor job telling the real story .
<n> A waste of time : Mo@@ stly pon@@ ti@@ fication .
<n> Reg@@ rett@@ ably , one has to wonder about the accuracy of his reporting on N@@ BC News .
<n> The phones are us@@ eless , and I &apos; m stuck with them . You can gu@@ ess my advice .
<n> )@@ : The book is the re@@ print of a old edition date back 1948 with some little update up to 1963 .
<n> : The introduction mix with lot of unusual verb@@ al , loud and un@@ pleasant voice !@@ !@@ !
<n> not that good : all the songs in my opinion are very che@@ es@@ ey .
<n> B@@ oring Wa@@ ste of Time !
<n> In my estim@@ ation it was pretty much a waste of time and a total waste of money .
<n> NOT M@@ UC@@ H TO SM@@ IL@@ E AB@@ O@@ UT HER@@ E !
<n> This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble , hor@@ ri@@ ble movie .
<n> The dialog was so contri@@ ved and min@@ dless .
<n> There was not a lau@@ gh to be had and the chem@@ istry between Kin@@ near and Hol@@ ly was non@@ exist@@ ent .
<n> Bro@@ ke in 10 months .
<n> The cost to repair it makes it us@@ eless because I would just have to repair it again in 10 months .
<n> We made a big mistake .
<n> The instructions are quite poor .
<n> : This is very od@@ d .
<n> It &apos; s just sad .
<n> So now I &apos; m stuck with doub@@ les of everything and out thr@@ ity bu@@ cks .
<n> I was not impressed .
<n> It is a RO@@ Y@@ AL pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving .
<n> H@@ ate it : We h@@ ate this thing .
<n> Scre@@ ws made of PL@@ AST@@ IC !
<n> However , after 3 days I noticed that one of the inner arms was loose .
<n> Bad release .
<n> I w@@ ouldn &apos; t recommend this book .... too much dam sex !
<n> Dr@@ unk Sp@@ on@@ ge@@ B@@ ob ?@@ ?
<n> A Dis@@ appointing movie .
<n> Wor@@ st Mo@@ vie in years !@@ !
<n> It &apos; s so ST@@ UP@@ ID !
<n> &quot; the longest and most bor@@ ing Sp@@ on@@ geb@@ ob episode ever &@@ quot@@ ;@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> Bad purchase .
<n> Big waste of money ( and space in my house !
<n> What a waste !
<n> A very simpli@@ stic and sel@@ fish point of view .
<n> It really su@@ cks !
<n> What a waste .
<n> At that time i h@@ ated the book .
<n> it was so bor@@ ing i just fell as@@ le@@ ep .
<n> what a disappointment
<n> First of all , the characters are the most bor@@ ing people in the world .
<n> Just don &apos; t read this book it isn &apos; t good .
<n> Along with the lack of plot , those in@@ consisten@@ cies are what make this a brutal read .
<n> Very bad work by Eli@@ zab@@ eth Spe@@ are review for Mr . Jones : I think this book was bor@@ ing .
<n> This is why this story was bor@@ ing .
<n> The characters were anno@@ ying and ob@@ t@@ use , it was hard reading such a dis@@ gu@@ sting piece of li@@ ti@@ ture .
<n> Kit was such an un@@ intelligent and s@@ no@@ ot@@ y creature it was in@@ fur@@ ating to read about .
<n> The quality of the dialogue was hor@@ ri@@ ble because it was very un@@ realistic .
<n> This book was also very bor@@ ing and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action .
<n> The events were very bor@@ ing and predictable .
<n> Their ano@@ ying voices and pa@@ thetic mel@@ o@@ dies are , well , anno@@ ying and pa@@ thetic .
<n> I will admit that the sound is much like older O@@ asis recordings , but that &apos; s just the problem .
<n> O@@ asis may be the most popular British band , but they aren &apos; t the best .
<n> Silver Sun , the D@@ and@@ ys , Sh@@ ed Seven , Cat@@ at@@ onia , Northern U@@ pro@@ ar )@@ , and that &apos; s a shame !
<n> wrong book right title : We were trying to get winter of the world by K@@ en Fol@@ let .
<n> However , the voc@@ alist of Su@@ gar@@ com@@ a fails to make the music enjoyable with her weak scre@@ aming .
<n> Su@@ gar@@ com@@ a just makes it anno@@ ying .
<n> Being nearly twenty years old , maybe some of my problems are with it being out@@ dated .
<n> worst investment : P@@ aid $ 300 . 00 for these about 5 years ago .
<n> The overall quality of sound and dur@@ ability was very disappointing .
<n> I especially did not enjoy Part II , when I just kept wonder@@ ing , what the h@@ eck is going on ?@@ ?@@ ?
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> no bat@@ mobile !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> It was not good .
<n> The dialog was aw@@ ful , the plot ridicul@@ ous ( we have to destroy it in order to save it )@@ .
<n> I think the magn@@ ets are way too weak .
<n> Dis@@ appointing : Firstly , I found this cream to have an od@@ d smell to it .
<n> ST@@ R@@ U@@ G@@ G@@ LE OF W@@ OM@@ EN : I was disappointed in this book .
<n> I was disappointed in the cold , comp@@ as@@ sion@@ less character of Char@@ lie K@@ ate .

<n> VER@@ Y frustr@@ ating .
<n> Too noisy : An anno@@ ying amount of h@@ um and h@@ is@@ s comes from my speakers .
<n> The audio on this d@@ v@@ d is hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> I w@@ ouldn &apos; t recommend this book to anyone who is not that good at math .
<n> Third , the movie is actually bor@@ ing ; a bor@@ ing Rob@@ oc@@ op movie !
<n> It won &apos; t even be a good Robo@@ C@@ op movie .

<n> Dis@@ appointing .
<n> This has the most number of failures .
<n> He and his brother are poor , his brother gets girls ( he doesn &apos; t )@@ ... bor@@ ing .. bor@@ ing .

<n> Just got it today and it s@@ ne@@ aks in all sorts of non@@ sense .
<n> i was very disappointed in it as it was noted no@@ where it was ch@@ ris@@ tian based .
<n> It doesn &apos; t fit well at all .
<n> B@@ loo@@ dy A@@ w@@ ful : I found this novel to be cum@@ ber@@ some and un@@ inspir@@ ing .
<n> G@@ ee , what a wonderful gu@@ ilt trip to impose on a gri@@ ev@@ ing mother ...
<n> Big disappointment and some mistakes with Civil War history .
<n> But he was quickly disappointed .
<n> Was just as disappointed with another spi@@ der@@ man bla@@ ster .
<n> Even those with mental illness are not so lack@@ lu@@ ster .
<n> : R kel@@ ly &apos; s car@@ rer is full of contradic@@ tions .
<n> But these never seemed to get broken in .
<n> h@@ ate it : I have been reading this book in my in@@ tro to native am@@ er@@ ican studies .. and I h@@ ate it ...
<n> I feel it give the wrong image towards nor@@ thwest native history ...
<n> This is NOT like the original Cro@@ pper Hop@@ per !

<n> Po@@ or product from dish@@ on@@ est dealer : Or@@ dered two , and b@@ illed for two , as Christmas presents .
<n> Would have given this a negative rating , if &quot; 1 &quot; were not the lowest number available .
<n> [ bad deal ]@@ : L@@ isti@@ n to The vel@@ v@@ et underground &apos; s Mur@@ der M@@ yst@@ ery and then listen to ch@@ op su@@ ey .

<n> Gu@@ il@@ ty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment : bor@@ ing , bor@@ ing and bor@@ ing .
<n> For that alone , it will burn in cin@@ em@@ atic hell .
<n> We@@ ak , very weak .
<n> Most of the performances are not very good .
<n> Despite R@@ ach@@ el Wei@@ s@@ z , the movie is bad and not even her talent could have saved it .
<n> When the old tired plot finally starts to un@@ ra@@ vel , we didn &apos; t care what was going on .
<n> I felt that the actors are an in@@ significant part of this movie , they don &apos; t matter .
<n> What the H@@ EL@@ L were they thinking ?
<n> I r@@ ented this movie expecting a sc@@ ary thri@@ ller and it almost put me to sleep .
<n> I was very disappointed for this film is just plain aw@@ ful !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> D@@ um@@ b and pretty bad .
<n> You get one of the worse movies ever made .
<n> Pre@@ t@@ ty bad : Very bad Ke@@ an@@ u Re@@ ev@@ es film that could be one of the worse films ever made .
<n> If she were not in the movie , my rating would be in negative numbers .
<n> I can not fa@@ th@@ om the audience for this film except for the blind , de@@ af and dum@@ b .
<n> It is hard to tell whether the fault is the script the director or the actor .
<n> In short the film was a total waste of time .
<n> This was the worse .
<n> : Hor@@ ri@@ ble can &apos; t describe this movie in a right light .
<n> R@@ ach@@ el Wei@@ s@@ z is great but the movie is a disaster .
<n> I trust Continental but this was a failure .
<n> W@@ AS@@ TE W@@ AS@@ TE W@@ AS@@ TE : All I re@@ all have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money .
<n> The worst part is that even after all of that , the g@@ um ta@@ sted terrible !
<n> I highly doubt that the manufacturer tru@@ ely tested this process with parents and children .
<n> Fru@@ str@@ ating and a waste of time .
<n> bor@@ ing : I was hoping to really get in to this but it was to bor@@ ing for me .
<n> Almost too bad for M@@ ST@@ 3@@ K ..@@ .@@ : This was one of the worst Sci Fi movies ever !
<n> terrible product : B@@ ought this to remove a wart .
<n> : I thought it &apos; s a score book , just like &quot; The Cor@@ rs / The Cor@@ rs &@@ quot@@ ;@@ , but I am totally wrong .
<n> Was I ever wrong .
<n> After a while of playing Ever@@ quest Online , this became very anno@@ ying and in@@ convenient .
<n> Dis@@ appointed !
<n> I w@@ ouldn &apos; t recommend buying this for that reason alone .
<n> All the songs are available on other c@@ d &apos; s so it &apos; s no problem ski@@ pping over this one .
<n> It seemed as if the book completely broke down and lost it after page 300 .
<n> An@@ alog reception proved even worse .
<n> I wasn &apos; t the only person in our club who was disappointed .
<n> It was a mis@@ er@@ able story and point@@ less .
<n> I don &apos; t know how those two got on this CD but fans of Kri@@ stoff@@ er@@ son should be en@@ ra@@ ged .
<n> The author failed to show me any reason to be afraid of these bodies .
<n> I don &apos; t want a replacement ... one bad experience is enough for me .

<n> Do Not Bu@@ y : This item did not work and it just ir@@ rit@@ ates your skin .
<n> Viol@@ ence Bon@@ jour ?

<n> TER@@ R@@ IB@@ LE !@@ !
<n> I tried to enter a 0 rating but I gu@@ ess 1@@ star is as low as you can go .
<n> B@@ oring characters , un@@ realistic scenarios .
<n> Another one ..@@ .@@ : ... of those bands whose latest work dis@@ ap@@ points me .
<n> Wor@@ st in the series thus far .
<n> : By far this is the worst book in the series .
<n> But this latest , The R@@ am Reb@@ elli@@ on , just st@@ in@@ ks .
<n> Not so much : I was very disappointed with this ring .
<n> Wor@@ th@@ less : This stuff is a ri@@ po@@ ff .
<n> Dan@@ ger@@ ous !
<n> It is a dangerous con@@ co@@ ction .
<n> It needs warning labels , and testing .
<n> Dis@@ appointed : I developed white spots on my legs after using a t@@ anning bed .
<n> Unfortunately it did nothing for me .
<n> Mark now has a price on his head for his death .
<n> Mark and his new family will fight for his freedom or die trying .
<n> Will Mark survive the war to go on to find the light or die defending his new life and family ?
<n> I was stup@@ id for not checking it out before I bought it .
<n> Des@@ j@@ ardin &apos; s arguments also suffer from the obvious om@@ is@@ sion of per@@ tin@@ ent , but contrary information
<n> L@@ az@@ y reproduction of an old book .
<n> P@@ ure Dis@@ s@@ appointment : I am sorry but this album was not what I was hoping it would be .
<n> so far it has been a battle .
<n> Im with J@@ im : The ped@@ als fell off , the seats broke off .
<n> Not a good deal at all !
<n> Dis@@ appointed in the quality and dur@@ ab@@ i@@ ity .
<n> What a st@@ in@@ ker : How did this piece of j@@ unk ever get made ?
<n> What &apos; s wrong with screen writers these days ?
<n> Its defin@@ ital@@ y not a classic or a good movie .
<n> It did not do well at the box office , and everyone else I know who saw it , did not like this movie .
<n> It wasn &apos; t as f@@ unny as any of the wes@@ terns .
<n> Very disappointed , not with deliver or anything just the content of the video itself .
<n> The worst book I have ever finished !@@ !
<n> It was te@@ di@@ ous and d@@ ull .
<n> I am now avoiding Mo@@ en f@@ auc@@ ets !
<n> granted there are a couple tracks that I thought were ok@@ ay , but the rest of the CD was a waste .
<n> Check out O@@ C@@ Z@@ s forums for many complaints about it being quite loud .
<n> It must be channel surfing , but there is no need for this .
<n> I was very disappointed in Ama@@ zon &apos; s service , in sending me the wrong movie !
<n> h@@ ate it : this would have been a good movie but the language ru@@ ined it all .
<n> will never watch again in fact will probably destroy it .
<n> M@@ other Night : Good shipping but the pages were scre@@ w@@ ed up !
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> How the hell did this happen !
<n> A bit disappointing .
<n> I was so an@@ gr@@ y I immediately thre@@ w it in the biggest tr@@ ash can I could find .
<n> I was so an@@ gr@@ y I didn &apos; t want to talk about it , let alone give time to write a review , until now .
<n> My real problem with his story is that it was so re@@ peti@@ tive .
<n> I also think that phone number given is f@@ ake , because nobody ever answers the phone .
<n> The material has a bor@@ ing sam@@ eness to it I am not used to in an Ol@@ dies Collection .
<n> Un@@ inspir@@ ing C@@ d : The songs are third rated ones that do not insp@@ ire .
<n> D@@ ull : I &apos; m not sure why this book got so many five star reviews .
<n> It &apos; s not a terrible book , but I found it to be incredi@@ ably predictable and d@@ ull .
<n> Wol@@ fe goes into a lot of us@@ eless ram@@ bling that has little if nothing to do with the plot .
<n> A minute into the first song I reg@@ ret@@ ted buying them .
<n> First of all , they &apos; re ug@@ ly as all hell .
<n> The noise canc@@ elling consists of a di@@ stra@@ c@@ ting static frequency , and there is no bass whatsoever .
<n> I was too di@@ stra@@ c@@ ted by the fact that it reminded me of bad early 8@@ 0s music .
<n> Pri@@ mi@@ tive concepts out@@ dated by to@@ days understanding : I have no doubt that C . S .
<n> It is worth@@ less .
<n> If I could give this book a N@@ EG@@ AT@@ IVE F@@ IVE , I would .
<n> What a disappointment !
<n> Not too impressed with this purchase .
<n> A disappointing book .
<n> : The hero@@ ine is a bloo@@ dy rac@@ ist ( which is taken for wi@@ t , I gu@@ ess )@@ .
<n> Too thin : I wanted to like these p@@ ants so bad .
<n> I verb@@ al review sections are practically us@@ eless , and the strategies do not work .
<n> I was very disappointed and had forgotten it before it was even finished .
<n> Not worthy of One Star .
<n> When it comes to l@@ ame , wi@@ tless and down@@ right stup@@ id movies , Ben Sti@@ ller is on quite a roll .
<n> WT@@ F ?@@ ?@@ ?
<n> Do NOT buy this edition of Democracy and Education : This edition of the book is absolutely aw@@ ful .
<n> H@@ ad to buy it : I was forced to buy this for a grad class and it was absolutely bor@@ ing .
<n> Not an easy read : I didn &apos; t enjoy reading this one .
<n> I know Har@@ dy isn &apos; t the most che@@ ery writer , but this was beyond just de@@ pressing -- it was bor@@ ing .
<n> The almost D@@ ick@@ en@@ sian sequence of hard - to - s@@ wal@@ low trage@@ dies was too contri@@ ved for my taste .
<n> Dec@@ ent products , unacceptable customer service -- buyer bew@@ are !
<n> I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone .
<n> A ha@@ gg@@ ish woman swe@@ ars at the unic@@ orn saying &quot; Dam@@ n you , dam@@ n you !@@ &quot;
<n> A tro@@ ll type creature says something like &quot; What the H@@ ell , am I supposed to look at .@@ &quot;
<n> Sho@@ cking .
<n> Sh@@ ame on R@@ ank@@ in B@@ ass
<n> How wrong I was .
<n> I am ash@@ amed to say that I let my children see this before I did .
<n> I am highly disappointed and so are my children because they cannot watch this movie .
<n> Some people like it , but i think it &apos; s a bad movie and doesn &apos; t have really good characters .
<n> Wor@@ se ( M@@ UC@@ H worse )@@ , the sound@@ track suff@@ ers from notic@@ able pit@@ ch in@@ consisten@@ cies .
<n> It sounds like a du@@ b from a B@@ AD c@@ ass@@ ette tape .
<n> If you don &apos; t care who s@@ ings , then buy it .
<n> I regret buying this c@@ d , because the voc@@ als don &apos; t appeal to me .
<n> Unfortunately on this c@@ d that option is not available .
<n> Dis@@ appointing !
<n> It &apos; s also bor@@ ing .
<n> Dis@@ appointed : I was very disappointed in this book .
<n> Very disappointing .
<n> Very dis@@ jo@@ in@@ ted .
<n> War@@ ning - misleading listing : This item is adverti@@ sed as being the R - rated ( original ) version .
<n> sound effects generation un@@ worthy of either the Disney mon@@ i@@ ker or Mannheim Ste@@ am@@ roll@@ er .
<n> Then I read this sequ@@ el and had to admit that it was likely the worst book I &apos; d ever encountered .
<n> The du@@ b@@ bing is bad and the plot is so un@@ original .
<n> Su@@ cked : I should have known that a Van D@@ amme movie would not be worth the time or money .
<n> It simply su@@ cked .
<n> Now the food co@@ oked using these tar@@ nis@@ hed pots are ta@@ sting bit bitter ( metal@@ lic taste )@@ .
<n> Very poor quality product .
<n> To say that they lack credibility would be an under@@ statement ( Air America , etc ?@@ )@@ .
<n> poor quality : I purchased this from renov@@ aters supply in March 2005 .
<n> The ch@@ rome pl@@ ating is also of poor quality .
<n> Rule # 1 : Just because it &apos; s published doesn &apos; t mean it &apos; s true .
<n> : This one of the worst ab@@ om@@ inations ever put in print to &quot; describe &quot; Catho@@ lic@@ ism .
<n> It is of note only for its lu@@ dic@@ ro@@ us claims , half - tru@@ ths , and ou@@ tri@@ ght lies .
<n> A sad jo@@ ke that still inf@@ ects some of the more na@@ ive minds out there .
<n> Tot@@ ally ignor@@ ant , very very poor@@ ly done or just plain inten@@ tional lies to mis@@ lead people .
<n> Not good enough : I like David and have seen him live .
<n> So I say it just wasn &apos; t good enough .
<n> I regret buying this book .
<n> It didn &apos; t help my vision : I followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind .
<n> This is a waste of money .
<n> No plot : The story plot of this movie su@@ cked .
<n> I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go .
<n> E@@ ww@@ ww@@ w ..@@ .@@ : What the hell ?
<n> Wei@@ rd and beyond distur@@ bing .
<n> I had trouble fig@@ uring this one out .
<n> Di@@ d@@ n &apos; t care for this one at all .
<n> I sup@@ pose the writer thought it would be wit@@ ty but it is just a ridicul@@ ous plot .
<n> ( Cher@@ yl is the daughter who died but Hor@@ n@@ berger describes Cher@@ yl as t@@ esti@@ fying at the trial .@@ )
<n> Simp@@ le pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading could have corrected these mistakes .
<n> There &apos; s no den@@ ying that the Tu@@ dor era was racy and dangerous .
<n> good idea , poor implementation : Po@@ or quality product .
<n> Very disappointing purchase .

<n> wh@@ o@@ ever called it a classic is cra@@ zy
<n> Wei@@ rd : I had to read this book for liter@@ it@@ ure class I h@@ ated it .
<n> Not the Best novel : Well I have read this in 7th grade .
<n> Very disappointed !@@ !@@ !
<n> It &apos; s a good book , but not my favorite : Gol@@ ding was trying to say that there is evil in everyone .
<n> I believe everyone does something that is evil .
<n> I think the author used a lot of description which made it really bor@@ ing .
<n> He also used too much violence , which in my opinion , only made it worse .
<n> I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash .
<n> If it was me who wrote the book , I would use less description bec@@ u@@ ase is made it bor@@ ing .
<n> : This book st@@ unk .
<n> I believe that reality can have deeper mean@@ ings , but don &apos; t get to deep or you &apos; ll dro@@ wn .
<n> Dis@@ gu@@ sted : I was dis@@ gu@@ sted by the gro@@ t@@ esque display of sav@@ ag@@ ery in this novel .
<n> B@@ oring : I would not rec@@ com@@ end this book .
<n> It was very bor@@ ing and I didn &apos; t find much of a purpose .
<n> The end was the best part , but it was still bad .
<n> Everyone should read it because it &apos; s a classic but I didn &apos; t enjoy it .
<n> Some@@ things I dis@@ liked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls .
<n> I also didn &apos; t like how P@@ ig@@ gy died .
<n> Dis@@ appointing : Out@@ dated and Not U@@ se@@ ful : This book was written in 1987 !
<n> But the lack of ex@@ tras is ir@@ k@@ some .
<n> However , I had trouble finishing this book .
<n> very d@@ ull and wi@@ tless : This was a d@@ ull read that I had to force myself to finish .
<n> Very concerned about The Ein@@ stein Syn@@ dro@@ me : First of all , I am quite off@@ ended by this author .
<n> I gu@@ ess I will never make it to that level , because I think this is one terrible book .
<n> All of this occur@@ ed after Wol@@ fe &apos; s death .
<n> Po@@ or Service from Home and Beyond : I still have not recei@@ vi@@ ed what I ordered and paid for .
<n> They claim the first shi@@ pp@@ em@@ nt was damaged and have yet to ship a replacement .
<n> Par@@ ker has tried to create a male Sp@@ enc@@ er but fails mis@@ er@@ ably .
<n> If I didn &apos; t know any better I could swe@@ ar that this book wasn &apos; t even edited !
<n> Paper quality is the worst .
<n> Not good : I tried to read it , it was just so bor@@ ing and bad .
<n> and the actors portra@@ ying C@@ lay Sha@@ w and David Fer@@ ri@@ e are hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> NO pin@@ y@@ in and NO example sentences .
<n> I am extremely disappointed .
<n> I repeat : NO Pin@@ y@@ in and NO example sentences .
<n> We can imagine much worse that what we see .
<n> Inter@@ esting , where the hell has D@@ ill@@ on been since this abortion of a film ?

<n> Very disappointed .
<n> I was not pleased : I was having trouble finding a copy of this classic movie anywhere .
<n> I am glad to have this in my collection nonetheless but was up@@ set it was not original .
<n> Sett@@ le in on a dark winter &apos; s night by a fire , put on some quiet music , and read the ep@@ ic po@@ em .
<n> Bad fight scenes .
<n> Take my advice and ski@@ p this sad attempt .
<n> Musi@@ cally and ly@@ ri@@ cally a disaster .
<n> I think the publish@@ er should be ash@@ amed .
<n> Not Good At All : This is the W@@ OR@@ ST movie I have EV@@ ER seen .
<n> I h@@ ated it .
<n> Even that part was bad , and I didn &apos; t see all of it !
<n> I &apos; d give it - 10 stars for hor@@ ri@@ ble scenes , cru@@ el@@ ty to animals , and lack of trying .
<n> poor : The product did not operate as stated on the box .
<n> Not good at all !
<n> This book is a total waste , though !
<n> What a disappointment !
<n> These movies really made me M@@ ISS the Robert U@@ rich series !
<n> I did not care for her writing style , nor did I find her information moving or educational .
<n> Unless she &apos; s an idi@@ ot .
<n> I would give this rating a negative 2 star@@ si@@ f I could .
<n> This is the worst design G@@ ill@@ ette has yet put forth .
<n> Som@@ ehow not as good as Bir@@ ks : They run M@@ UC@@ H smaller than Bir@@ k@@ enst@@ o@@ cks .
<n> A huge disappointment !
<n> Money wast@@ ed .
<n> I think you wrong the part , I receive Part No .
<n> Very disappointed : The NC@@ IS movie i ordered came in in a timely manner .
<n> I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one .
<n> These have gone to the tr@@ ash as is fitting for such lack of mar@@ ality .
<n> terrible : Continu@@ es to free@@ ze movie and my TV .
<n> U@@ sel@@ ess . suggest no one get this .
<n> This one really su@@ cks .
<n> This re@@ e@@ a@@ all@@ ly bad movie suff@@ ers from everything .
<n> Lo@@ t &apos; s of familiar faces in this , but their acting is un@@ inspired , and the script is d@@ read@@ ful .
<n> The plot concerns a plot to get an inher@@ it@@ ance and a b@@ unch of gre@@ edy hei@@ rs .
<n> W@@ AT@@ CH A W@@ O@@ MAN G@@ ET RA@@ P@@ ED , BE@@ AT , & TER@@ RO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ED .
<n> Did anyone witness this woman being rap@@ ed ?
<n> People are just going on a murder &apos; s word that she was rap@@ e by these men .
<n> You would never say it was ok@@ ay for a man to murder a woman no matter what she did to him .
<n> This is sex@@ ist and sick .
<n> It is about the rap@@ ing of a girl and she gets re@@ ven@@ ge .
<n> Not a Great Book : I was a little surprised by the content of this book .
<n> I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a mess@@ y head of fri@@ zz@@ y hair .
<n> Very un@@ happy .
<n> A waste of money , to say the least .
<n> I gu@@ ess the stress of sitting in the cab@@ inet for a few weeks was too much for it .
<n> Tri@@ ed it the second time to see if I just wasn &apos; t using it right , and still wasn &apos; t thri@@ ll@@ ed .
<n> It is now in my dead he@@ ap pi@@ le of un@@ used hair g@@ ad@@ gets .
<n> It is difficult to man@@ eu@@ ver and not powerful enough to blow out my short fli@@ pp@@ y style .
<n> But on normal paper , it f@@ lar@@ es and distor@@ ts writing .
<n> Le@@ ading character was very im@@ moral and there was language .
<n> poor product : I brought this product 7@@ m@@ ths ago and it has been falling apart .
<n> she &apos; s so d@@ ull : She started out as the &quot; German Brit@@ ney Spe@@ ars &quot; and somehow she got stuck there .
<n> A waste of money !@@ !@@ !
<n> The characters lack@@ ed personality and didn &apos; t look as interesting as the others .
<n> i must say , i was highly disappointed .
<n> This book is full of lies .
<n> What it pre@@ aches is b@@ lat@@ antly wrong and you would be a f@@ ool to believe a word of it .
<n> Unfortunately .@@ , I was disappointed .
<n> The movie while po@@ ign@@ ant , was sp@@ as@@ modi@@ c and dis@@ jo@@ in@@ ted .
<n> By the way , I think Cour@@ t@@ ney put a hell of a show on at the tour !
<n> Man@@ son ... a bit sick .
<n> Wor@@ th@@ less : Do@@ esn &apos; t fit the average 10 &quot; sub@@ woo@@ fer .
<n> It is hor@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> N@@ ever &@@ quot@@ ;@@ , available from Pil@@ gri@@ m Bre@@ th@@ ren Press , po box 17@@ 1 , Petersburg , O@@ hi@@ o 4@@ 4@@ 4@@ 54 .
<n> Too bad he didn &apos; t study some of the books he listed .
<n> mer@@ lin : not that good .
<n> Di@@ ff@@ icul@@ t .
<n> Wor@@ st film ever ?
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble : I am only 14 years old .
<n> It was the biggest waste of money in my life .
<n> Yu@@ ck , Yu@@ ck , Yu@@ ck : I h@@ ated this movie .
<n> S@@ ure , maybe there are some little fre@@ aks running around rap@@ ing and drinking and be@@ ating .
<n> NO@@ BO@@ D@@ Y acts like this ! What the hell is the point of this movie ?
<n> To sc@@ are the cra@@ p out of parents ? Also , the rap@@ e scene was vi@@ le .
<n> A F@@ UL@@ L MIN@@ UT@@ E L@@ AT@@ ER , I started feeling aw@@ k@@ ward and un@@ comfortable .
<n> It wasn &apos; t even artistic , it was just dis@@ gu@@ sting and truly distur@@ bing .
<n> something u would &apos; nt expect : this movie is terrible .
<n> char@@ ectors are weak and the plot just pl@@ ains su@@ cks on white bread .
<n> Why put us through 500 pages of pain .
<n> I am the only person I know who h@@ ates Emm@@ a .
<n> Rub@@ b@@ ish : What rub@@ b@@ ish . Way too much violence .
<n> Why do kids movies have to be so violent these days ?
<n> We both felt this book was too basic and we did not get helpful information .
<n> The numerous ty@@ pos are di@@ stra@@ c@@ ting and the characters lack depth .
<n> S@@ am Z@@ em@@ an was lau@@ gh@@ ing so much he lay back on the floor , but then ch@@ oked and had to sit up .
<n> A@@ w@@ ful movie .
<n> Ac@@ ting is ok@@ ay to bad , quality is ok@@ ay to bad , story is ok@@ ay to bad .
<n> H@@ oping , But NO : Was hoping other reviews were off , but unfortunately they were right .
<n> you get a double p@@ unch on your Hur@@ ter Card for sitting through this .
<n> It &apos; s the worst book which has ever been written .
<n> U@@ ly@@ ss@@ es : This book is a struggle .
<n> Ital@@ ics are cap@@ itali@@ zed : Sub@@ stit@@ uting cap@@ itali@@ zation for ital@@ ics is unacceptable .
<n> Dir@@ ty and cheap : Can you make a cheaper case that these chips come in ?
<n> Po@@ or Quality : The quality of the case is poor .
<n> Some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow ?
<n> My biggest complaint about this book is that most of the chapters were bor@@ ing .
<n> No@@ where near@@ as f@@ unny as the Sc@@ ary Mo@@ vie movies .
<n> A very , very bad movie : I recently witnessed this car crash of a movie .
<n> One of the worst out there .
<n> The writers had alo@@ t to work with , but they failed mis@@ er@@ ably .
<n> Tor@@ ture to watch : I went to see this but it was not by choice .
<n> So does all the Sc@@ ary Mo@@ vies ( I don &apos; t like these either )@@ .
<n> The hum@@ or and mo@@ cking was so dis - tast@@ eful and a little offensive .
<n> D@@ ated and D@@ ull : This is wa@@ a@@ ay before the age of personal train@@ ers .
<n> Wor@@ st movie in history : Where to start ?
<n> This thing is so bad that it is a dis@@ grace to bad mel@@ o@@ drama .
<n> The plot is so predictable it is si@@ ck@@ ening .
<n> I was sad to discover that Chris O &apos; Donn@@ ell can &apos; t act .
<n> Part of the problem might go to the director .
<n> In fact the director is highly suspect .
<n> Di@@ ff@@ icul@@ t Vie@@ wing : This film is difficult to watch for many reasons .
<n> Ref@@ und : This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen .
<n> We were both very lost for about the first 25 minutes .
<n> : I was extremely disappointed with Air@@ plane II : The Sequ@@ el .
<n> But since I &apos; ve seen the sequ@@ el , it has@@ n &apos; t been as f@@ unny .
<n> Not Just &quot; Bor@@ der@@ line &quot; Ter@@ ri@@ ble -- It Is Ter@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> This movie is so bad I don &apos; t know where to start .
<n> It &apos; s even worse than &quot; Bo@@ dy of E@@ vi@@ dence &quot; and that &apos; s saying something .
<n> Mad@@ onna is at her all time low , and it is a low that few stars ever reach .
<n> Bad : The video kept timing out .
<n> H@@ OR@@ R@@ IB@@ LE , W@@ AS@@ TE OF T@@ IM@@ E !
<n> : This book is one of the worst books I &apos; ve ever read .
<n> the story was kin@@ da weak .
<n> But its a sequ@@ el i gu@@ ess . D@@ ont waste your time .
<n> Was not very good and was a bit way too camp@@ y .
<n> The film is poor .
<n> it was as dum@@ b as dum@@ b can get .
<n> What a waste of time : This refers to the Australian Region 4 Coll@@ ector &apos; s Edition .
<n> Who car@@ es about this when the film is so pa@@ thetic .
<n> Some@@ thing this film is wo@@ efully lacking .
<n> Such sh@@ it : This movie is the worst of modern movie making : big budget , small art .
<n> I like the photo illu@@ stration concept but the book content itself is distur@@ bing .
<n> As a child , I myself found it highly distur@@ bing .
<n> Would absolutely not recommend this product at all .
<n> There is too much unnecessary information and the &quot; 60 minutes &quot; peoples &apos; portra@@ yal is too harsh .
<n> The Emperor Has No C@@ lo@@ thes : Too bad there is not a rating of MIN@@ US - stars .
<n> This film is gar@@ b@@ age ; bor@@ ing , pre@@ ten@@ tious , and meaning@@ less .
<n> Perhaps other reviews can attach their own fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es and for them this DO@@ A film may say something .
<n> But I found it an ir@@ rit@@ ating waste of time .
<n> Even if it is technically ( grammatically ) correct , it is extremely difficult to read .
<n> Very bor@@ ing .
<n> Stil@@ ted broken part - way descri@@ p@@ tive sentences .
<n> I really didn &apos; t care if they ended up together .
<n> This was definitely a du@@ d , no offen@@ se intended to the author of course .
<n> I am very disappointed in it . We will be purchasing an electric bug z@@ app@@ er soon to replace these .
<n> I &apos; m greatly disappointed
<n> A th@@ our@@ ough disappointment .
<n> I &apos; t get &apos; s really old after a@@ while listening to her compl@@ ain !
<n> Compar@@ ed to the first two epis@@ odes , &quot; Los Angeles &quot; is lament@@ ably l@@ ame .
<n> P@@ ath@@ etic movie feels like a made for TV movie !
<n> I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ru@@ in it for other readers / vie@@ wers .
<n> S@@ O over@@ rated : This is a top con@@ tender for the worst book ever written .
<n> This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it .
<n> not the worse film or acting ..@@ .@@ : but defin@@ ately not the best or even above average .
<n> A Train W@@ rec@@ k : This film really mis@@ ses its mark .
<n> 0 Star Pres@@ entation of a 5 Star Mo@@ vie ; Sony / Image Li@@ ed : This is a@@ pro@@ pos of the DVD version .
<n> All I can really say is that I was truly disappointed and I don &apos; t know who was at fault .
<n> : Has James Pat@@ ter@@ son sun@@ k so low that he &apos; s now p@@ enn@@ ing dri@@ vel just for the money ?
<n> I am an@@ gr@@ y that his publish@@ er was so gre@@ edy to do it !
<n> His l@@ ame dialogue is beyond te@@ di@@ ous .
<n> -- he has a brain tum@@ or and is likely to die .
<n> Maj@@ or@@ ly su@@ cked : This book was j@@ am - packed with c@@ liches and wooden characters and dialogue .
<n> Some of the worst writing I have ever read !
<n> I don &apos; t know which group is singing but it &apos; s the wrong one .
<n> Dis@@ appointing .
<n> Compl@@ ete waste of time : I think this is the worst re@@ make of any movie of all time .
<n> really B@@ AD Sony transfer .
<n> Gran@@ ted the film is supposed to take place at night , the new transfer is quite frank@@ ly aw@@ ful .
<n> From terrible dialogue to terrible themes , this movie is just TER@@ R@@ IB@@ LE ...
<n> no extra features !
<n> First of all there are no making of , stor@@ y@@ board , production notes or any extra features !
<n> Pin@@ oc@@ chio not the only one who lies !
<n> No where in the dis@@ cription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version !
<n> This movie was such a bad movie !
<n> But that &apos; s not what I &apos; m here to talk about , I &apos; m here to talk about how bad this movie is .
<n> Not very good : I actually ordered two dir@@ t@@ bags and within a week , they were both le@@ aking di@@ rt .
<n> I wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it , instead of stories of an@@ gr@@ y , sad boys .
<n> Quite possible the worst movie of all times .
<n> Extre@@ m@@ ely tor@@ tur@@ ous to watch .
<n> Dis@@ appointing .
<n> A disappointment !
<n> I was app@@ alled .
<n> What business ref@@ uses to replace damaged items ?
<n> Very disappointed : This is a set book for the University course I &apos; m following .
<n> Not her best : I love Vir@@ g@@ inia Hen@@ ley but these characters are so dis@@ connected and un@@ romantic .
<n> I wat@@ ched this scene from my window with hor@@ ror and I still am not sure what to do about this .
<n> A heavily armed S . W . A . T team to@@ ss@@ ed in a few te@@ ar gas can@@ ist@@ ers and broke down my front door .
<n> Can of cancer : I got some of this stuff to cover myself with during Hal@@ lo@@ ween .
<n> : It did little more than power a death star , so I returned it to the Earth forces ... DO NOT B@@ U@@ Y !
<n> WAR@@ N@@ ING : DO NOT E@@ AT : Or@@ atory in@@ ges@@ tion is not recommended .
<n> This is dist@@ res@@ sing , at first .
<n> Most of the second act is d@@ ull .
<n> R@@ ent only if you want to anno@@ y your boy@@ friend .
<n> B@@ oring , sil@@ ly and a waste of time . What do men want ?
<n> This is dist@@ res@@ sing , at first .
<n> Most of the second act is d@@ ull .
<n> R@@ ent only if you want to anno@@ y your boy@@ friend .
<n> Besides if you get rid of D & D who will you blame when they finally do kill someone ?
<n> What is far worse , though , is that the editing in this book is hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous .
<n> There are sp@@ elling errors throughout the text .
<n> There are many gramm@@ ati@@ cal errors in this edition .
<n> ? Just did not enjoy them really .
<n> TER@@ R@@ IB@@ LE , TER@@ R@@ IB@@ LE .
<n> And a point that should go out , TH@@ ER@@ E IS NO CA@@ R CH@@ ASE !
<n> I will end by saying that this tr@@ ash@@ y film deser@@ ved no os@@ cars !
<n> : I never thought that Mar@@ yl Stre@@ ep could give a bad performance .
<n> I could have gone without buying this foo@@ lish@@ ness
<n> Wor@@ th@@ less !
<n> I did everything I could to ins@@ ure they would adhere well , but to no av@@ ail .
<n> I really don &apos; t recommend this product .
<n> : Purch@@ ased this a while back , and was disappointed from the moment I opened the box .
<n> All this thing did was waste time and money .
<n> dr@@ ying and sti@@ cky : I didn &apos; t care for this product at all .
<n> The characters are cold and it is difficult to emp@@ ath@@ ise with them .
<n> continuous sus@@ pen@@ se , con@@ vol@@ utions , but no resolution .
<n> : I rather liked &quot; D@@ une &quot; but this poor excuse for a sequ@@ el is just plain aw@@ ful !
<n> Time and again I found some pass@@ ages aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly wor@@ ded .
<n> W@@ ho@@ ever made the kin@@ dle version should be fi@@ red .
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ bly Dis@@ appointing : First , I will be u@@ pf@@ ront : I didn &apos; t get very far in this movie .
<n> I was very disappointed with this movie .
<n> It critici@@ zes everything about Jan@@ e Au@@ sten &apos; s time period .
<n> As strange as it sounds , I felt like I was being attacked through the movie screen .
<n> It is a movie full of lies .
<n> Unfortunately , the book is nothing more than a lead in to the show .
<n> Very frustr@@ ating .
<n> This is a cheap p@@ lo@@ y to su@@ cker you in to watching the series .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble fast forward and back@@ wards , goes to slow .
<n> Wor@@ st CD player I have ever owned .
<n> Not a her@@ o .
<n> Some of them were even being held prisoners by the enemy at the time .
<n> Camp@@ a@@ ign for K@@ erry : To call this book an un@@ bi@@ ased look at K@@ erry &apos; s life is extremely na@@ ive .
<n> Wa@@ ste of time and money : This book is a waste of valuable paper .
<n> I h@@ ated the book and have no respect for the man behind it .
<n> For example , we usually prohi@@ bit ad hom@@ in@@ em attacks .
<n> Sh@@ ame !
<n> Sh@@ ame !
<n> Dan@@ ger@@ ous !
<n> The information is misleading (@@ &quot; G@@ PS@@ r : S@@ lang of a GPS recei@@ ver .@@ &quot;

<n> You had nothing better to do with your time and money .
<n> Min@@ dless , Po@@ int@@ less and Ins@@ ul@@ ting : Bad .
<n> Just plain aw@@ ful .
<n> A total waste of time for the thinking movie go@@ er .
<n> It s@@ ad@@ dens me that movies have come to this .
<n> The acting : bad , the st@@ un@@ ts : bad , the plot : VER@@ Y bad .
<n> I w@@ ouldn &apos; t wish seeing this movie on my worst enemies ( even tho@@ gh I have none )@@ .
<n> Tri@@ ple Bad !@@ !@@ !
<n> V@@ in Dies@@ el is the worst actor .
<n> For AN@@ Y@@ BO@@ D@@ Y to call him the &quot; new James B@@ ond &quot; is sad and lau@@ gh@@ able .
<n> The st@@ un@@ ts in this movie are a@@ wes@@ ome , but the acting and plot is H@@ OR@@ R@@ IB@@ LE !@@ !
<n> I felt ash@@ amed that I wat@@ ched this movie because it ins@@ ul@@ ted my intelligence .
<n> This movie was S@@ O bad and to think it was a block bu@@ ster hit !@@ !@@ !
<n> I saw him in the Fast and the Fur@@ ious , Pit@@ ch Black , Bo@@ iler Room , and so on .
<n> I was S@@ AD@@ L@@ Y D@@ IS@@ SA@@ PO@@ IN@@ T@@ ED by this movie .
<n> Between the medi@@ oc@@ re acting and the tired fighting scenes .
<n> It leaves u dra@@ ined .
<n> depl@@ or@@ able : this was the worst example of am@@ er@@ ican literature ever published .
<n> this book is a waste of your time , don &apos; t read it !
<n> Po@@ int@@ less : This book was prof@@ ane and point@@ less , as is w / most books I &apos; m forced to read for English .
<n> I never knew being in AP ment I had to put up with my belief@@ s being violated .
<n> What a dis@@ grace for the St@@ ones to put out this L@@ ous@@ y album .
<n> O@@ h , Ple@@ ee@@ ze : The ly@@ rics on B@@ ig@@ ger@@ b@@ ang are so bad !
<n> The cost@@ umes in the Phar@@ o@@ ah &apos; s scene are offensive and in poor taste .
<n> The first few bags were super but bag five , which was still in code , ta@@ sted n@@ asty , as did bag six .
<n> D@@ U@@ MB D@@ U@@ MB AND D@@ U@@ MB : this is by far the worse hor@@ ror movie ever .
<n> P@@ LE@@ A@@ ZE do not DO NOT buy this movie and if u do yer scre@@ w@@ ed
<n> The video was made in 1939 , when color had just come out , and the quality of the color is aw@@ ful .
<n> Despite great acting by De N@@ ir@@ o , this movie su@@ cks .
<n> I seriously felt dum@@ ber after watching this movie ; there was absolutely no plot .
<n> No plot , no cul@@ min@@ ation , no action , no transition , no ST@@ OR@@ Y .
<n> : Tal@@ k about be@@ ating a dead horse .
<n> W@@ as@@ n &apos; t very impressed , especially after all the h@@ ype .
<n> Bo@@ y , was I wrong .
<n> This is indeed hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous f@@ ake s@@ wing that doesn &apos; t hold a cand@@ le to the original masters .
<n> Building the Cust@@ om Home Office : This has to be the worst book I have ever seen on the subject .
<n> U@@ sel@@ ess book .
<n> Unfortunately , the DVD is the worst analog to digital transfer I &apos; ve ever seen .
<n> They should fire the guy who made this DVD version .
<n> I rarely ever rate anything on Ama@@ zon , but this is so bad I felt like I had to war@@ n other people .
<n> and as an extra side - note , the music feels ridicul@@ ous .
<n> I wish I had read the reviews online prior to purchasing , now I am stuck with a poor quality DVD .
<n> TER@@ R@@ IB@@ LE DVD Sound - A@@ void the DVD !@@ !
<n> A truly hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous offen@@ se for an anim@@ ated movie , which depends so much on sound .
<n> Dis@@ appointed ..@@ .@@ : What a b@@ ummer .
<n> The worst part is the poor quality of the DVD .
<n> The quality of the movie is aw@@ ful too .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble DVD Transfer : My experience has been in line with several others here .
<n> I like the film , but the quality of this transfer is just unacceptable - do not buy .
<n> I have no idea how they mess@@ ed that up !
<n> Cau@@ tion before downloading : The Kin@@ dle Touch version has been problematic for me .
<n> Dis@@ cour@@ aged .
<n> On my list , these are the characteristics of a bad movie .
<n> It is d@@ ull and pre@@ ten@@ tious !
<n> you g@@ ot@@ ta know when to fold em Kenn@@ y : U@@ gh !
<n> S@@ ad how they are being paid for this gar@@ b@@ age .
<n> Scott H@@ ic@@ ks comm@@ entary is one of the most bor@@ ing on any DVD .
<n> Now we are stuck with $ 120 . 00 worth of re@@ arm kits that are of no use to us .
<n> The Messenger portra@@ ys Jo@@ an as a mental case who was uns@@ ure of herself and full of doubts .
<n> &quot; Also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely grat@@ uit@@ ous and unnecessary .
<n> this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible .
<n> they made jo@@ an so anno@@ ying i did@@ nt want to watch it no more .
<n> the action was not good at all .
<n> The acting is so bad some of the fighting sequ@@ ences are lau@@ gh@@ able .
<n> I don &apos; t know what kind of recording equipment was used , but the sound is terrible !
<n> ST@@ U@@ ART L@@ IT@@ T@@ LE IS FOR PE@@ O@@ PL@@ E WHO D@@ ON &apos; T F@@ ALL IN LO@@ VE WIT@@ H THE RA@@ T ON CH@@ AR@@ L@@ OT@@ TE &apos; S WE@@ B !
<n> Not very good : I &apos; m not a huge fan of Medi@@ eval literature , and perhaps this book is to blame .
<n> Also the book , which is hum@@ or@@ less , remin@@ ds me of other better - done accounts of the same areas .
<n> But was I wrong !
<n> Bad Book !@@ !@@ !
<n> I thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards .
<n> The fitted sheet have started p@@ iling , which indicates not a good quality set of sheets .
<n> Overall , a disappointing read .
<n> I didn &apos; t really like the book it was bor@@ ing , the end = best .
<n> : It was gr@@ at at some parts and bor@@ ing at others .
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> He went cra@@ zy when he saw the commercial for this new DVD .
<n> And we , too , were bit@@ terly disappointed by its contents .
<n> Ne@@ ed something to light a fire ?
<n> Here you go ..@@ .@@ : I gave this one star , because negative stars are not allowed .
<n> The script leaves you not car@@ ing for the characters .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble customer service .
<n> Gen@@ u@@ ine Chinese Cra@@ p : This radio is ins@@ an@@ ely over - priced .
<n> Want poor reception ?
<n> LO@@ US@@ Y PH@@ ONE : Good Price with a nice package , but very poor quality sound .
<n> poor quality : It@@ em is very heavy and does not hold a charge well .
<n> ill@@ um@@ ination beg@@ ns to di@@ m almost immediately and is never very bright .
<n> Even more the light di@@ ms almost instantly after sha@@ king with no retention of charge whatsoever .
<n> I &apos; m very disappointed with this purchase .
<n> This movie is very poor and I believe it only stayed in theat@@ ers for about a week before tan@@ king .
<n> Not Rec@@ omm@@ ended : I am very disappointed with this phone .
<n> Not happening here . What dialogue and acting there is seems forced and badly delivered .
<n> At times it was just stup@@ id !
<n> Dou@@ bt I &apos; ll be re - watching this movie any time soon !
<n> Even then , I worry that the package will open in transit . L@@ ess@@ on learned .
<n> sent wrong speaker : Spe@@ aker they sent was a cheap im@@ at@@ ation .
<n> L@@ ous@@ y 8@@ 02 . 11 reception & transmission .
<n> That &apos; s the sound of millions of An@@ ne of Green G@@ ables fans scre@@ aming in collective dis@@ g@@ ust .
<n> Not only is this last An@@ ne movie bad .
<n> It &apos; s H@@ OR@@ R@@ IF@@ Y@@ ING@@ L@@ Y bad !
<n> I was extremely disappointed that the movie thoroughly stra@@ yed from L . M .
<n> The plot of this movie held no interest for me , and was extremely disappointing .
<n> Not only was it a far c@@ ry from the book version , I found it to be incredibly ins@@ ul@@ ting .
<n> Not the same as An@@ ne 1 & 2 .@@ : This was a major disappointment .
<n> Its far to ar@@ ts@@ y and revol@@ ves around the war rather than the characters and green gab@@ les .
<n> I was so disappointed .
<n> It left me feeling sick to my stom@@ ach at such a gross departure from the books and story line .
<n> Not worth it at all and very disappointing !
<n> It &apos; s quite hor@@ ri@@ ble in every way .
<n> I wish I could give it negative stars !
<n> Big Problems with Ama@@ zon &apos; s Quality Control : The DVD did not match the title of the cover .
<n> Liter@@ ally the wrong movie was in the &quot; An@@ ne of Green G@@ ables - The Continu@@ ing St@@ ory &quot; sle@@ eve .
<n> I was very disappointed .
<n> Not as Good : I didn &apos; t like the Continu@@ ing St@@ ory as much as Green G@@ ables and Av@@ on@@ le@@ a .

<n> Two major problems with this ro@@ uter : 1 .
<n> Wireless range is B@@ AD ( I own a cheap ro@@ uter and it has twice the range ) 2 .
<n> I managed to fix the problem for a few weeks but it RE@@ T@@ UR@@ NE@@ D !@@ !
<n> Its a pain !
<n> L@@ ous@@ y support after the sale : We lost the hand@@ set .
<n> Overall disappointed with Panasonic and this phone .
<n> Unfortunately lighting hit and ble@@ w out all my phone lines and phones .
<n> The options they gave me were completely unacceptable .
<n> It is a f@@ ake product .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble product I want my money back .
<n> They look com@@ fy but the front stra@@ p is sti@@ ff and just cuts right into your to@@ es .
<n> There is no such thing as out sm@@ ar@@ ting wall street !@@ !
<n> The guy called and told me it needs a new fir@@ ing mechanism and it would cost $ 18@@ 9 .
<n> This was very frustr@@ ating be@@ ac@@ au@@ es I have to return it .
<n> Very disappointed .
<n> I had been trying to take them for my di@@ ges@@ tive problems , but these were actually making me worse !
<n> Very def@@ ective bottle .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble product : This is a terrible product .
<n> Bro@@ ken Dri@@ vers for Windows XP : I &apos; ve had a hor@@ ri@@ ble time with this F@@ 5@@ D@@ 60@@ 20 PC@@ M@@ CIA card .
<n> Absol@@ utely no thought has gone into design .
<n> Tom Sell@@ eck is aw@@ ful .
<n> Merc@@ edes Mc@@ Cambridge is aw@@ ful ( really aw@@ ful )@@ , and s@@ adly , worst of all is Gl@@ enn Ford .
<n> The examples are s@@ app@@ y and sac@@ char@@ ine . C@@ ut@@ es@@ y kids , flowers , b@@ la b@@ la b@@ la !
<n> Its a waste of money .
<n> Por@@ table red f@@ las@@ h@@ light : Ter@@ ri@@ ble product .
<n> He makes incredible errors of historical fact - well known historical fact , at that .
<n> I ignored the whole rating thing which is absurd .
<n> Wor@@ th@@ less : As a beginn@@ er I found this book worth@@ less .
<n> In my opinion this book fails on all counts .
<n> This did not work for Dre@@ am Street , unfortunately .
<n> I am very disappointed since i got the wrong item .
<n> I wast@@ ed my money since I can &apos; t even read it !
<n> Sim@@ ult@@ ane@@ ously pre@@ ten@@ tious and mor@@ onic : This is even more brain - dead than the average ra@@ p CD .

<n> I would give it no stars if it was available !@@ !
<n> hor@@ ri@@ ble : B@@ ought it one and half year ago from Cir@@ cu@@ it city .
<n> What a Sh@@ ame : There is a lot of background music in this film that never made this collection .
<n> B@@ ummer .
<n> Why did I waste my $@@ $@@ $@@ $@@ $@@ ?
<n> Bo@@ y was I wrong .
<n> The bin@@ der part wasn &apos; t very good either .
<n> It is that bad .
<n> O@@ uch : This movie hur@@ ts me to watch it .
<n> St@@ even Seg@@ al gets shot up , put in a com@@ a , and then he goes off killing people for re@@ ven@@ ge .
<n> The action is really che@@ es@@ y , the plot is aw@@ ful , and the one lin@@ ers make you want to shoot Seg@@ al .
<n> This line was a m@@ ess up , the correct line is : &quot; I missed .
<n> I must be lam@@ er than I thought .
<n> Such a shame .
<n> All I know is this : I &apos; m sick and tired of reading about these dum@@ b jur@@ ies !
<n> It starts off very strong , but half way through and all the way to the end , it is aw@@ ful .
<n> Re@@ ading this book was a ch@@ ore not a pleasure .
<n> It was such a bor@@ ing book that it &apos; s a wonder that I even finished it .
<n> After the murder trial , which takes place very quickly , the book begins to sa@@ g .
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> The Last Jur@@ or is tired , bor@@ ing , deriv@@ ative and a waste of time .
<n> What a disappointment !
<n> The worst G@@ ris@@ ham book out there !@@ !@@ !
<n> : I have read most , if not all , of G@@ ris@@ h@@ ams books and this one was by far the worst !@@ !
<n> It is very bor@@ ing , has no sus@@ pen@@ se , and j@@ umps around a lot .
<n> What a terrible book .
<n> G@@ ris@@ ham has lost his touch ....@@ : Dri@@ vel and more Dri@@ vel .... G@@ ris@@ ham has lost his touch .
<n> Th@@ row in point@@ less and grat@@ uit@@ ous nu@@ de scenes , a pair of bo@@ ots with six - inch he@@ els and a weak plot .
<n> Even the obvious physical tal@@ ents of B@@ ai L@@ ing don &apos; t save this film , despite her best efforts .
<n> P@@ ain@@ fully d@@ ull , poor@@ ly written ri@@ p - off * SP@@ O@@ IL@@ ERS *@@ : F@@ ear@@ less meets the Six@@ th S@@ ense .
<n> This movie is bad .
<n> Too bad .
<n> bad : previous review was never printed .
<n> Too bad .
<n> : Ex@@ pen@@ sive as it is , I thought I &apos; d have something that would give me no trouble .
<n> This one is not a great re@@ make of the book .
<n> Would not highly recommend .
<n> The casting was almost completely off the mark - Dan@@ us is particularly badly cast .
<n> This was so bad it took me 3 tr@@ ys to get through to the end .
<n> It was delivered promptly , but the book print quality seems to be bad .
<n> I was quite an@@ gr@@ y that I &apos; d spent $ 1 . 08 at my discount video to even rent it .
<n> B@@ OR@@ ING !@@ !
<n> Home Fi@@ red !
<n> This film was a bomb from the word go .
<n> ( I had the same problem with the new version of Up@@ stairs - Down@@ stairs , also by A@@ cor@@ n Media .@@ )
<n> NOT OR@@ IG@@ IN@@ AL ART@@ IS@@ TS : This is NOT a comp@@ ilation of Original Rel@@ e@@ ases .
<n> I &apos; m un@@ happy !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> I was extremely disappointed .
<n> I really didn &apos; t care what happened to him or any of the characters in the book .
<n> A big disappointment : I disagree with the re@@ viewer who characterized the author as a poor writer .
<n> The problem is the content .
<n> On all those measures , Ms . P@@ ow@@ ell suff@@ ers . My recommendation : see the movie , but forget the book .
<n> N@@ ever in my entire life have I found the nar@@ r@@ ator of a book more ir@@ rit@@ ating than I did P@@ ow@@ ell .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble : I found this book to be simply un@@ read@@ able .
<n> Very , very disappointing .
<n> Stay as a Blog@@ ger : This is a terrible book .
<n> Ju@@ lie P@@ ow@@ ell is , on her own admission , not a good co@@ ok and the text proves it .
<n> And on the evidence of this book she is not a good writer either .
<n> I doubt it .
<n> Po@@ or Juli@@ a - p@@ asse she may be , but she must be turning in her grave at this trav@@ esty .
<n> The level of prof@@ an@@ ity was so di@@ stra@@ c@@ ting that I couldn &apos; t focus on what the author was saying .
<n> I gu@@ ess I &apos; ll have hang out with the hat@@ ers .
<n> Ju@@ lie P@@ ow@@ ell comes off as an extremely un@@ pleasant , im@@ mature little pr@@ inc@@ ess .
<n> The whole thing is sn@@ ark and wh@@ ine and it ti@@ res@@ ome after a few chapters .
<n> Don &apos; t waste your time or money on this aw@@ ful book !
<n> She tried to be f@@ unny - and failed mis@@ er@@ ably .
<n> Unfortunately , I didn &apos; t enjoy much about it .
<n> In fact , she was so di@@ stra@@ c@@ ted that most of the time she could not get out of her own way .
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble R@@ eci@@ pes Made Bear@@ able : As I &apos; m more than hal@@ f@@ way through this book I might as well finish .
<n> I h@@ ate it , h@@ ate it , h@@ ate it and have from the first few pages .
<n> The author should be ash@@ amed using her sing@@ ular great@@ ness to make money with this cr@@ ass gar@@ b@@ age .
<n> Bo@@ y , was that a bad decision .
<n> I could have avoided many sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess nights if I did that earlier !
<n> Defin@@ itely the worst baby product I &apos; ve purchased .
<n> They have 2 sizes but no chart to figure out which size you need .
<n> Other reviews have said the small was too small , so I &apos; m not sure .
<n> Too bad it never arrived and I had to sc@@ ram@@ ble at last minute to find a copy .
<n> So either these are NOT really from Power@@ Stop , or I was lied to .
<n> Then every time you try to open the wi@@ zard it f@@ las@@ hes on the screen for a second and dis@@ appears .
<n> Do@@ esn &apos; t work and mer@@ ch@@ ant won &apos; t allow returns : This product is hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> : I just spent hours of fru@@ stration trying to get this thing to work reli@@ ably .
<n> No M@@ re sequ@@ als !
<n> In fact , I do not see why this movie got a PG - 13 rating for violence .
<n> To@@ bey was good as Spi@@ der@@ man but his character seemed a bit wh@@ iny and was too much of an idi@@ ot .
<n> It &apos; s in my opinion if I didn &apos; t like it don &apos; t get mad why I didn &apos; t like it I just didn &apos; t like it .
<n> : I can understand just wanting to watch a tr@@ ash@@ y action film but this movie was just anno@@ ying .
<n> Seri@@ ously , this was a casting disaster that the marketing department saved .
<n> That said , the rest su@@ cks .
<n> Money wast@@ ed .
<n> Don &apos; t listen to the other re@@ vie@@ wers it su@@ cked !
<n> : I did not like Spi@@ der@@ man 2 at all (@@ ..@@ .@@ )@@ !
<n> I h@@ ate To@@ bey Mag@@ u@@ ire and all of his movies they su@@ ck and he &apos; s also bor@@ ing who never says a word .
<n> But any@@ ways don &apos; t waste your money on this movie it &apos; s very bad .
<n> Both Spi@@ der@@ man movies su@@ ck !
<n> A@@ w@@ ful - N@@ early P@@ ain@@ ful : I liked the first movie .
<n> the acting was hor@@ ri@@ ble and the action scenes ... well there were hardly any action scenes .
<n> This movie su@@ cked there was way too much talking .
<n> Do@@ c O@@ c was hor@@ ri@@ ble he wasn &apos; t even mean .
<n> The back@@ stab@@ bing pir@@ ati@@ cal vil@@ la@@ in .
<n> The fat , ug@@ ly , co@@ war@@ dly , cor@@ rupt , rich vil@@ la@@ in .
<n> The cru@@ el vil@@ la@@ in who is , however , a &quot; true war@@ ri@@ or &@@ quot@@ ;@@ .
<n> I was VER@@ Y disappointed to find out neither were included .
<n> But this c@@ d is En@@ y@@ as worst .
<n> bor@@ ing , bor@@ ing , bor@@ ing : Some have called this book a &quot; basic guide &quot; for the En@@ ron m@@ ess .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble shame .
<n> It seems like the motor is bad or just too weak .
<n> Asi@@ mo@@ v is probably rolling around in his grave right now .
<n> O@@ h , how stup@@ id can they be ?
<n> They st@@ ole the title and we shall pun@@ ish them by for@@ getting this mis@@ er@@ able mut@@ t .
<n> I ordered it a second time thinking that I had received a def@@ ective disc the first time .
<n> I was wrong .
<n> What a trav@@ esty that this book was published !
<n> : Dra@@ g , drag , drag .
<n> This story had no cli@@ max , no capture , no passion .
<n> Who wants to read about the som@@ ber day to day lives of bor@@ ing sp@@ inst@@ ers ?
<n> Or , maybe you have to be on some kind of illegal drug to make any sense of this movie ?
<n> I tr@@ yed bit@@ ing it to see if it was cand@@ y , but to no av@@ ail it was actually the d@@ v@@ d .
<n> T@@ He movie actually scar@@ ed me , and i had to go to the store to buy beer , and asp@@ r@@ in .
<n> That Bo@@ y Mike Jones Is A F@@ ake Man : That boy mi@@ ke j@@ ones is about to get what is coming to him .
<n> S@@ adly not the case , it was a lack@@ lu@@ ster title .
<n> After a year and a half , this battery is dead .
<n> IT IS PO@@ OR@@ L@@ Y ED@@ IT@@ ED AND F@@ UL@@ L OF T@@ Y@@ P@@ OS AND ER@@ RO@@ RS .
<n> Good movie , terrible DVD : I have no problems with the movie .
<n> But technically , the quality of this disc is beyond terrible .
<n> This book shows one side , from an emotional person who was h@@ urt and an@@ gr@@ y .
<n> no acc@@ ol@@ ades here : I thre@@ w this book in the tr@@ ash , I was so very disappointed .
<n> Po@@ or : A very poor book .
<n> It &apos; s mostly just a b@@ unch of ram@@ bl@@ ings , often contradic@@ tory .
<n> The description of the book is highly misleading , and I regret having bought it .
<n> S@@ ad to say the music won &apos; t .
<n> Greek : This was not a very good movie , nor well acted .
<n> I doubt they would last long .
<n> W@@ RO@@ NG !

<n> Bad product .
<n> All the signs point to a hardware problem .

<n> It was a waste of my money .

<n> In - fur - i@@ ating : This movie is really quite unfortunate .
<n> Another &quot; Po@@ or little Women &quot; novel ....@@ : G@@ ina and La@@ wr@@ ence are the main characters of the book .
<n> G@@ ina goes through every &quot; poor me &quot; emo@@ tion from the di@@ vor@@ ce and it gets ob@@ no@@ x@@ i@@ ously anno@@ ying !
<n> End@@ less , dra@@ gging , re@@ peti@@ tive , no action .
<n> The writers s@@ adly appear to have let the series down .
<n> What &apos; s Her Problem ?
<n> : I read this book and it &apos; s obvious that Ear@@ th@@ a K@@ itt has a problem with being black .
<n> and the negative terminal connec@@ tor fle@@ w apart each time .
<n> Very frustr@@ ating in that att@@ aching to anything of any size causes it to self - destru@@ ct .
<n> Po@@ or product : I have had 2 f@@ aul@@ ty units right out of the box .
<n> It was re@@ peti@@ tive , ram@@ bling and bor@@ ing .
<n> The big bat has to be seen to be believed , and its attack c@@ ry is really something .
<n> I was not happy with the outcome .
<n> the worst .
<n> I thought that was book wasn &apos; t that great .
<n> I am sorry I wast@@ ed my money on it .
<n> I was deeply disappointed .
<n> Review fraud : The Institute for American Indian Studies did not review this book .

<n> Er@@ rors and more errors : I was so exc@@ ited to get this book .
<n> War@@ ning will not play : WAR@@ N@@ ING .... be careful of buying this unless you have a HD DVD .
<n> Too bad I bought this DVD as none of my players can view it and can not return it .
<n> But there seems to be a bizarre confusion on this product page and in the reviews that follow it .
<n> It &apos; s really di@@ stra@@ c@@ ting as you attempt to read .
<n> It was tru@@ ely hor@@ rid .
<n> hor@@ ri@@ ble : One of the worst books I have ever read .
<n> If it were not in fact his parent &apos; s publishing company I doubt he would have been published .
<n> It &apos; s quite sad that there is nothing new in this book .
<n> : The kind of rep@@ ete@@ tive , ban@@ al , Tol@@ k@@ ien - refer@@ ren@@ ced non@@ sense that gives fantas@@ y a bad name .
<n> YO@@ UR W@@ RO@@ NG !
<n> Call me cra@@ zy .. but they sound famil@@ ar ... I &apos; m sorry I wast@@ ed 3 hours reading this book
<n> Take it out from the library and see what you think because it &apos; s quite possible you &apos; ll h@@ ate it .
<n> : This was one of the worst books I have ever read .
<n> The plot was quite interesting , but the way it was wr@@ tit@@ ten was hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> It dra@@ g@@ ged on and on about un@@ important topics and was extremely bor@@ ing .
<n> No one needs that many ad@@ j@@ ectives per sentence ! P@@ ain@@ fully generic and nothing at all special .
<n> &quot; I W@@ AS FOR@@ CE@@ D TO RE@@ AD TH@@ IS BO@@ OK AT G@@ UN@@ PO@@ IN@@ T B@@ Y F@@ AN - BO@@ Y TER@@ RO@@ R@@ IS@@ TS !

<n> Po@@ or@@ ly written and rather bor@@ ing .
<n> Don &apos; t fall for this and waste money lining this author &apos; s po@@ ckets .
<n> I rate this as N@@ EG@@ AT@@ IVE - 5 star !
<n> I was so confused with this made up language and the the main character dro@@ ve me nu@@ ts !
<n> bor@@ ing and , well , bor@@ ing .
<n> Don &apos; t let the ra@@ ve reviews f@@ ool you !
<n> The pro@@ se is uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ative , very wor@@ dy , and fails mis@@ er@@ ably on all levels .
<n> You Can R@@ un But You Can &apos; t Hi@@ de : This book is a ri@@ p off the famous Star War@@ s S@@ aga .
<n> It may have been an enjoyable read but still pa@@ thetic .
<n> I dis@@ liked it because it was contri@@ ved , poor@@ ly written , and lacking any re@@ de@@ em@@ ing quality .
<n> Par@@ ents before letting your kids read this think twice about the poor example being set .
<n> I think Pa@@ ol@@ ini counted on the fact that most people haven &apos; t read Ed@@ ding &apos; s master@@ piece .
<n> If you must see this trav@@ esty , complete the experience with st@@ ale pop@@ cor@@ n .
<n> What a dirty tri@@ ck : R@@ an into Best@@ buy today grab@@ bed the first DVD of Pot@@ ter I saw .
<n> What a dirty rot@@ ten tri@@ ck pul@@ led by War@@ ner Bro@@ thers .
<n> Betra@@ yed : If you are a fan of the book do not watch this movie .
<n> This movie targets the min@@ dless .
<n> where did the house el@@ ves go , when is fu@@ dge g@@ onna call du@@ mb@@ led@@ ore mad ?
<n> i quote : &apos; har@@ ry po@@ tter and the g@@ ob@@ let of fire is about H@@ AR@@ R@@ Y P@@ OT@@ T@@ ER , and THE G@@ O@@ B@@ LE@@ T OF F@@ IR@@ E .
<n> So , the book fails on two fron@@ ts .
<n> En@@ ough Ch@@ umps Will Bu@@ y It Any@@ way : G@@ ob@@ let of Fire , the movie , is an unacceptable h@@ ash .
<n> It would be a complete waste of money even if the book did not exist .
<n> This is not a film but an ins@@ ult .
<n> its not th@@ t great hon@@ est@@ ly .
<n> What a H@@ OR@@ R@@ IB@@ LE book .
<n> I am a p@@ re - teen@@ ager and I still cannot focus on it because of its pure stup@@ idity .
<n> Is bor@@ ing from start to end and has no point !
<n> What the hell does this book mean ?
<n> How do you keep an idi@@ ot busy for hours ?
<n> If there is someone you really don &apos; t like , suggest that they read this book .
<n> the stup@@ id@@ est book i have ever read !
<n> : i thought this book was the dum@@ best book i have read in a long time .
<n> i h@@ ated it .
<n> So d@@ ull .
<n> I &apos; m not sure if it &apos; s the style of the nar@@ r@@ ation or what it is , but I found it a struggle to read .
<n> However , on Ama@@ zon &apos; s very own Kin@@ dle Fire HD that feature is not available .
<n> The ep@@ it@@ em@@ y of F@@ antas@@ y : This &quot; book &quot; is a trav@@ esty to everything ever written .
<n> S@@ wo@@ ar , li@@ l &apos; fo@@ ols w@@ ack for RE@@ ALL .
<n> A waste
<n> This book scar@@ ed me .
<n> I found it sex@@ ist and almost rac@@ ist .
<n> Sel@@ fish and la@@ zy .
<n> I see a lot of readers loved it , but I thought it was a waste of time .
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> S@@ ad to say , they &apos; re not .
<n> There was absolutely no new pl@@ ots involved .
<n> What a shame .
<n> Do we have to have her show how to make fire over and over and over ?
<n> Te@@ di@@ ous : B@@ oring and te@@ di@@ ous !
<n> H@@ ard - to - remember names , and an error - ri@@ dden Kin@@ dle trans@@ cription add to this reader &apos; s fru@@ stration .
<n> S@@ ame old , same old ... but worse : Read the first couple of pages and then ski@@ p the next 250 .
<n> Even Ay@@ la &apos; s skills as a medicine woman can &apos; t revi@@ ve this victim .
<n> Wor@@ st Book I have E@@ ver Read !
<n> I was disappointed .
<n> Bad graphic design .
<n> Te@@ di@@ ous : Sor@@ ry but I had alo@@ t of trouble even finishing this book .
<n> No stars , No story : Unfortunately Ama@@ zon doesn &apos; t let you rate a book with zero stars .
<n> I find Au@@ el &apos; s latest book very bor@@ ing simply because there is nothing new in the book .
<n> B@@ OR@@ ING stuff .
<n> They were so gre@@ edy they had to have 2 h@@ un@@ ts ?
<n> I would give NO stars if the rating system allowed that .
<n> Kind of makes you wonder why he almost left her behind out of fear of his people &apos; s reaction .
<n> : I eag@@ erly awa@@ ited the coming of this book but after reading it I am sorry I wast@@ ed my time .
<n> What little bit of action that did happen was so weak that is wasn &apos; t even action !
<n> No real fin@@ ality to the problems that were introduced in the last book .
<n> And with the new problems introduced in this book , the reader is left with a sense of loss .
<n> No closure to Ay@@ la &apos; s pain about Dur@@ c .
<n> I was quite disappointed compared with other audi@@ ob@@ ooks that I have listened to .
<n> bor@@ ing bor@@ ing bor@@ ing !
<n> This unique story shows how the March si@@ sters deal with problems together .
<n> This film was not at all fai@@ thful to the book .
<n> The amount of errors really b@@ aff@@ led me and stressed me out .
<n> Tr@@ ying to look up things and the entire layout is just aw@@ ful .
<n> Perhaps someone lost a bet or Sch@@ iller owns their soul .
<n> A bad ch@@ ess player that writes aw@@ ful books is a sc@@ ary thing .
<n> Can@@ ni@@ bal Women in the A@@ voc@@ ado Jung@@ le of De@@ ath is another fine example of his dry wi@@ t .

<n> This c@@ d is terrible

<n> It still would have been bor@@ ing , but maybe not as bor@@ ing .
<n> Pro@@ found@@ ly worth@@ less .

<n> Not at all pleased with this purchase .
<n> I bought it for my grand@@ daughter who told me it h@@ urt her eyes to read it .
<n> I thought the book was rather bor@@ ing and was hard for me to get into .
<n> I was expecting the main character to met@@ am@@ orph@@ se into a serial k@@ iller but it doesn &apos; t happen .
<n> Problem With These Dis@@ cs : Is anyone else having issues with these disc@@ s ?
<n> I &apos; m ex@@ changing my disc@@ s immediately , but I have a feeling they might all be bad .
<n> They supposedly didn &apos; t know who did it so how do they explain having the murder weapon ?
<n> It &apos; s a shame , because the book had so much potential .
<n> Too bad she wast@@ ed it on such tri@@ vi@@ ality and sh@@ allow@@ ness .

<n> O@@ h , it &apos; s true ... What a waste of time !
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble !@@ !

<n> I understand that was Car@@ p@@ enters Ide@@ a , but it was stup@@ id .
<n> book was destroyed .
<n> I was hor@@ ri@@ bly dis@@ sa@@ pointed .
<n> There was no character study , no plot that I could see , nothing .
<n> Wa@@ ste of money , che@@ ating !
<n> it is only audio music of bra@@ d pa@@ is@@ ley , with 2 stup@@ id background sli@@ des .
<n> a big che@@ at if you expect to see som@@ eh@@ ting of bra@@ d pa@@ is@@ ley ...
<n> Nothing pleasant about this product .
<n> very , very weak : It &apos; s amazing how weak this album is .
<n> The worse movie since &quot; The English Pati@@ ent .

<n> To release a l@@ ame transfer of TH@@ IS film is in@@ exc@@ usable !
<n> so@@ da -- f@@ ills you up , but no nutrition .
<n> Don &apos; t support this kind of cra@@ p transfers .
<n> The video is really anno@@ ying !
<n> Dis@@ appointing !@@ !@@ !
<n> And I h@@ ated &quot; Ben H@@ ur .@@ &quot;
<n> : IT RE@@ ALL@@ Y ST@@ IN@@ KS !@@ !
<n> The movie fails because it was bad told , and not well directed .
<n> ! Absol@@ utely pa@@ thetic showing by Ama@@ zon .
<n> Po@@ or Video Transfer : This is an absolutely terrible transfer .
<n> War@@ ning Will Rob@@ inson !@@ !
<n> A disaster of over the top DN@@ R & E@@ E ; What were they Th@@ in@@ king ?@@ !
<n> Compar@@ ed to initial reports of Bra@@ veh@@ ear@@ t this Blu - ray release is clearly a disaster .
<n> Sh@@ ame on you , Scot@@ t@@ mus .
<n> : This book was so aw@@ ful I couldn &apos; t make it past page 60 .
<n> The plot was bor@@ ing .
<n> S@@ ad to say I didn &apos; t like this book ...
<n> b@@ la : I thought that this book was just kind of bor@@ ing .
<n> The only thing is most of the plot is about how they got su@@ cked into another world .
<n> One Of The W@@ OR@@ ST Films I have E@@ ver Seen !@@ !@@ !
<n> This Film was a M@@ am@@ mo@@ th FA@@ IL@@ UR@@ E on ALL LE@@ V@@ EL@@ S !
<n> The Script was terrible , there was really no story whatsoever and it just did@@ nt make sense !
<n> S@@ ean P@@ enn To me is the greatest actor of our generation but this was his W@@ OR@@ ST PER@@ FOR@@ MAN@@ CE !
<n> They are lying to you !
<n> Unfortunately my introduction to it was tut@@ oring for an introduc@@ tory class .
<n> Very un@@ happy with the fact that they seem to be broken .
<n> B@@ oring , te@@ di@@ ous , predictable ..@@ .@@ : I was extremely un@@ happy with this film .
<n> Speed - searching didn &apos; t even help .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble Mo@@ vie : I wat@@ ched it and thought of it as just bad .
<n> : I don &apos; t know what you people see in this movie , but it just made me ill !
<n> With terrible production design with n@@ aked woman / dining tables and that psych@@ adel@@ ic apartment .
<n> Though some may argue that that is not important to the story , I dis@@ s@@ agree .
<n> Kub@@ ri@@ ck is no geni@@ us ... he &apos; s sick !
<n> There are some stories to which movies just can &apos; t do justice .
<n> Total waste of money !
<n> My G@@ F h@@ ates this stuff too so it was a total loss !
<n> SO@@ FT AND P@@ RE@@ D@@ IC@@ T@@ AB@@ LE : The attempt to make another Dest@@ ro@@ yer fell very short .
<n> : Dis@@ appointing .
<n> This album is bad in so many ways .
<n> That &apos; s no bad .
<n> The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can &apos; t get down , Just a little bor@@ ed .
<n> There &apos; s no feeling , no emo@@ tion , no heart , no music .
<n> I still regret it .
<n> Basi@@ cally , I say this album was a waste of money .
<n> The Num@@ ber is Zer@@ o : What a waste of paper and time !
<n> K@@ iller of SS@@ X !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> This one was very disappointing .
<n> The music was hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> I h@@ ated the g@@ ame@@ play . This is ba@@ is@@ ically the game .
<n> In fact , I read it three times and still felt rather confused .
<n> Jo@@ e - O@@ h No !
<n> His version of Ste@@ ely D@@ an &apos; s &quot; King Of The World &quot; sounds stra@@ ined .
<n> The other two shor@@ ts are not Bur@@ rou@@ ghs related and are hor@@ rid .
<n> however , the characters didn &apos; t do anything about their problems .
<n> the book just makes you want to commit suicide or something .
<n> well , at least i get $ 10 for getting an A in my stup@@ id english class .
<n> It moves slowly , and I catch myself losing focus while reading .
<n> I feel like I &apos; m back in HS tor@@ turing myself to read a book .
<n> Dis@@ appointed : I was also disappointed with this book .
<n> Overall , a big disappointment
<n> Who wasn &apos; t made like other fol@@ ks , and for many artists that &apos; s a necessary evil .
<n> They &apos; ve lost it : Pear@@ l J@@ am died , and this was the nail in the coff@@ in .
<n> G@@ one are the fur@@ ious be@@ ats of V@@ s , the mel@@ odi@@ c ench@@ ant of Ten , and the pure gr@@ unge soul of Vit@@ alog@@ y .
<n> All I hear is a weak , tired band that has run out of fuel .
<n> when i first listened to it i was sup@@ ris@@ ed how bor@@ ing it was .
<n> The band that just won &apos; t go away : This has to be the most bor@@ ing album of all time .
<n> Right up there with Y@@ ield , Ri@@ ot Act and No Code .
<n> War@@ ning : this album is hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> Is the album bad ?
<n> I w@@ ouldn &apos; t buy this album , not even for its cont@@ ag@@ ious opening &quot; Her@@ mes &@@ quot@@ ;@@ .
<n> You lost out on my money because I am not going to give my father a virus .

<n> Sor@@ ry Sant@@ ana , I &apos; m not interested enough to even bo@@ ther although I &apos; ve been a fan for MAN@@ Y years .
<n> Stu@@ ff Ro@@ ot@@ kill : I broke this piece of j@@ unk in half , it did damage to my PC .
<n> That &apos; s after I find a way to get rid of the virus this thing infected my PC with .
<n> My computer has since been h@@ ack@@ ed .
<n> Sor@@ ry Carlos , but .... I will say .... u@@ gh !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> This is so bad that I couldn &apos; t even finish listening to the CD .
<n> B@@ oring .
<n> Re@@ ally a big b@@ ummer .
<n> If your c@@ ub@@ es are hol@@ low or sl@@ ush@@ ie this is the problem .
<n> I cont@@ acted GE with 50@@ 2 - 4@@ 52 - 4@@ 20@@ 5 they dis@@ miss the problem and cost .
<n> A H@@ U@@ GE Dis@@ appointment : I have to admit this CD is my most major dis@@ appoint so far this year .
<n> Mc@@ Cl@@ oud came through ( barely )@@ , but the others acted half dead .
<n> Wa@@ ste of money and dangerous Ster@@ o@@ ids too : This stuff was a waste of money .
<n> There are a couple of major problems however .
<n> The Z@@ en suff@@ ers very badly by comparison .
<n> W@@ r@@ ong item received : I ordered the hard@@ cover book pic@@ tured at a price of $ 66 .
<n> : This book is a waste of money .
<n> A real m@@ ess !
<n> The book was mostly just bor@@ ing .
<n> &quot; A negl@@ ected , and now hi@@ de@@ ously can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized , master@@ piece . For shame , Mr . B@@ achel@@ der .
<n> Not f@@ unny .
<n> Po@@ or s@@ ati@@ re .
<n> Not well written : I was greatly disappointed with Be@@ ar V . Shar@@ k .
<n> I was really , really disappointed .
<n> Works for 6 weeks : This unit broke , simply stopped working after six weeks since opening the box .
<n> Do not buy : I had this gun about 6 months before it just qu@@ it working .
<n> It died in late July 2012 .
<n> Then last Saturday the gun just died .
<n> the book , to put in simple , non - C@@ lan@@ cian terms , S@@ UC@@ KS !
<n> Clearly it &apos; s not the dum@@ best book I &apos; ve ever read , but it is the worst .
<n> Too bor@@ ing , too long , too technical , too empty .
<n> cra@@ p : This was pretty cra@@ p none of the kids like them and they are not amazing at all .
<n> My kids thre@@ w them in the tr@@ ash first day , just a waste of money
<n> Bro@@ ke down in 3 weeks : Product just qu@@ it working 3 weeks after I got it .
<n> The graphics are aw@@ ful .
<n> I feel I was ri@@ pped off paying $ 50 . 00 for this far@@ ce .
<n> Bad Rem@@ ake : This song when sung by Berlin was won@@ de@@ ful and not voc@@ ally over@@ done .
<n> Dro@@ pped it and it broke : I bought the 8@@ 10 model , which is similar .
<n> : The first time I tried this , it damaged the camera &apos; s lens cover mechanism .
<n> Dis@@ appointed : I &apos; m a big Louis Pri@@ ma fan but I was very disappointed with this c@@ d .
<n> It didn &apos; t capture the exc@@ itement of a Louis Pri@@ ma show .
<n> Anim@@ ated D@@ ean Martin Dol@@ l : I really find it difficult to rate this item for the following reason .
<n> Unfortunately it did not perform as expected .
<n> This book is aw@@ ful !
<n> This book is very bor@@ ing and us@@ eless .
<n> A student can not read this book , it is too bor@@ ing and us@@ eless .
<n> Wa@@ ste of Money .
<n> This is a waste of [@@ $@@ ]@@ .
<n> Absol@@ utely no f@@ ren@@ ch van@@ illa taste at all , it &apos; s not just a weak taste , there is NO T@@ AS@@ TE !
<n> Seri@@ ously , who would do such a stup@@ id thing .
<n> Dis@@ gra@@ ceful : This DVD is a dis@@ grace .
<n> P@@ ath@@ etic .
<n> How can they be so stup@@ id ?
<n> It su@@ cks !
<n> Mis@@ leading information on DVD case .
<n> W@@ RO@@ NG !@@ !@@ !
<n> To make matters worse the DVD cover says &quot; R@@ unning Time : Appro@@ x .
<n> I stru@@ gg@@ led to pick it up ..@@ .@@ : N@@ ever have I been so bor@@ ed by a novel set in Ireland .
<n> I stru@@ gg@@ led to pick this book up each night ( rather than put it down )@@ .
<n> : I am so sick of these things being released without CD@@ MA / EV@@ DO or some cell service .
<n> Does not power up after initial charge : This item arrived DO@@ A after initial Char@@ ge .
<n> I thought upgra@@ ding the OS system would fix the power problem .
<n> Maybe just a bad bat@@ ch , I think I &apos; ll order the N@@ 8@@ 10 instead and cross my f@@ ing@@ ers .
<n> Th@@ ie movie sets up with a father - daughter conflict that you &apos; ve seen in hundreds of other movies .
<n> Then comes the part when the girl argu@@ es a lot with the father .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble Service : I am completely anno@@ yed with this company .
<n> I ordered a movie and they sent the wrong one .
<n> not delivered : thanks for nothing .
<n> L@@ ots of violence and cru@@ el@@ ty that just went on and on .
<n> It has lost it &apos; s continuity and is very dis@@ s@@ appointing .
<n> : This product ru@@ ined at least 3 brand new batteries .
<n> I g@@ lan@@ ced at the page he had open and am hor@@ ri@@ fied at what I read .
<n> A mistake : I acci@@ dently bought two copies of this DVD .
<n> Kin@@ dle version has problems : This Kin@@ dle version of the book has quite a few ty@@ po@@ graphical errors .
<n> I could usually make them out , but it IS ir@@ rit@@ ating .
<n> The vocal post@@ uring anno@@ ys and di@@ stra@@ cts .
<n> The batteries are really really bad .
<n> And unfortunately they did not build in an adap@@ ter to use the included AC plug .
<n> Bad engineering . Bu@@ y a c@@ ord@@ ed gun if you are serious and never worry about batteries again .
<n> Well , he almost completely fails in that and , the worst , conf@@ uses the reader .
<n> Bad writing .
<n> Bad , bad writing .
<n> : Does anyone say &quot; Cra@@ zy get@@ up &@@ quot@@ ;@@ ?
<n> Also , finding 3@@ V Li@@ thi@@ um batteries is not easy .
<n> Just didn &apos; t care for it .
<n> African Archit@@ ecture : Hu@@ gely disappointing .
<n> More than just a little bit disappointing for those of us who are still looking .
<n> Cra@@ p , just cra@@ p : Book is highly bor@@ ing as rest@@ ates the same thing over and over .
<n> And this is of all the cra@@ p that is am@@ er@@ ican history .
<n> Because they are just so bor@@ ing .
<n> Plus just because your am@@ er@@ ican and the story is am@@ er@@ ican doesn &apos; t make it great you mother *@@ *@@ *@@ *@@ *@@ *@@ *@@ .
<n> H@@ ope the book ro@@ ts in hell .
<n> It was mostly a dry historical perspective of the author &apos; s family which wasn &apos; t that interesting .
<n> The author must be an extremely anno@@ ying s@@ no@@ b .
<n> Hist@@ ori@@ ans have been getting a lot of negative public@@ ity lat@@ ely for less that exemplary schol@@ ar@@ hip .
<n> I disagree .
<n> Not For Me ..@@ .@@ : So I don &apos; t really understand why this is considered a hor@@ ror novel ?
<n> If you want something that is sc@@ ary then this is not for you .
<n> : When I put this on my car vis@@ or , it was vis@@ ually di@@ stra@@ c@@ ting and made me feel c@@ lau@@ stro@@ ph@@ ob@@ ic !
<n> Having 30 CDs hang@@ ing over my head is just not a good idea .
<n> Most of the people that buy it will likely only be buying it because they are forced to .
<n> hard to follow : I don &apos; t care for the author &apos; s abuse of the time line .
<n> Dur@@ as &apos; character development is firm , but her f@@ las@@ h@@ backs are ill tim@@ ed and conf@@ using .
<n> Unfortunately , it ended with a sk@@ it@@ tering th@@ ud and had me mut@@ tering &quot; What the hu@@ h ?@@ &quot;
<n> Tr@@ ying to mix the two was a BI@@ G mistake .
<n> This movie was way too long , way too slow , too self - involved and overall just d@@ ull .
<n> Not true .
<n> Just because of the anno@@ y@@ ance factor I am not .
<n> They gave me long term pain in my teeth ( about a years worth )@@ .
<n> These do NOT work ... I promise !
<n> I &apos; ve tried them and the commerci@@ als are dec@@ ei@@ ving .
<n> The per@@ ox@@ ide isn &apos; t strong enough .
<n> I don &apos; t know how safe that could be , but it &apos; s not very promising to me .
<n> THE W@@ R@@ IT@@ ING IS VER@@ Y ST@@ IL@@ T@@ ED AND IT@@ S J@@ US@@ T NOT A COM@@ FOR@@ T@@ AB@@ LE RE@@ AD .
<n> Wor@@ st -- Mac@@ be@@ th -- E@@ ver !
<n> Can &apos; t imagine Mr . Bre@@ tt &apos; s excuse for as ab@@ y@@ sm@@ ally poor acting .
<n> H@@ ack writing at its la@@ zi@@ est .
<n> Ti@@ es@@ to your mix and track selection is bad !@@ !@@ !
<n> And am de@@ pressed with the current state of tr@@ ance music .
<n> re@@ peti@@ tive re@@ peti@@ tive re@@ peti@@ tive re@@ peti@@ tive : how many times can you say the same thing ?
<n> ? just ask Gord@@ on before you waste your money on this .
<n> I had made a bad bet .
<n> I &apos; m not thri@@ ll@@ ed with the performance .
<n> I am skep@@ tical and will not do it again .
<n> I &apos; ve seen numerous errors in sp@@ elling .
<n> Bad Edition : I would not buy this edition .
<n> The printing is terri@@ bly small .
<n> Be@@ ware : NO 5th BO@@ OK !
<n> Smo@@ key and the Ban@@ dit Pur@@ suit Pack : The quality of this 3 movie DVD was terrible .
<n> Its too bad the 2nd movie didn &apos; t play , because I thought this one was nearly as good as the first .
<n> Tot@@ ally inf@@ erior to anything on the full length CD .
<n> This radio had more static than the broken one I had .
<n> I purchased my M@@ 5 in January and this mounting device has already broken .
<n> : I did not care for this book at all .
<n> B@@ oring Book .
<n> I got what was happening ( mostly )@@ , but it was the dum@@ best story .
<n> There was no point and i was about to fall as@@ le@@ ep hal@@ f@@ way through - Tot@@ ally bor@@ ing !
<n> A Total Wa@@ ste of Money : I &apos; ve used this battery backup for less then a year and it no longer works .
<n> I never compl@@ ain about print , but this book is just d@@ read@@ ful .
<n> I sup@@ pose I got what I paid for ; the quality of this one is just aw@@ ful .
<n> I found Per@@ su@@ asion difficult to get into and did not enjoy it .
<n> The tape , I &apos; m afraid , is very bad indeed .
<n> : Maybe we just got a bad one , but it doesn &apos; t work .
<n> Would it have killed the studio ?
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> Then all the problems aro@@ se .
<n> I thought that would be the end of it , however , THE RE@@ PL@@ AC@@ EM@@ ENT M@@ AC@@ H@@ INE IS B@@ RO@@ K@@ EN NO@@ W TO@@ O !
<n> S@@ ad , without coffee !@@ !
<n> This bre@@ wer is a piece of cra@@ p .... look at the Ham@@ il@@ ton Beach instead .... Sig@@ ne@@ d@@ K@@ eur@@ ig Su@@ cks !
<n> But now it is failing .
<n> Don &apos; t know if I want to buy another one if it is going to go bad like the last one .
<n> NOT worth it - tons of problems : I am so up@@ set about my coffee maker .
<n> Plat@@ in@@ um series is terrible : B@@ ought a plat@@ in@@ um series bre@@ wer .
<n> Multi@@ ple problems ; makes a full cup inter@@ mitt@@ ently .
<n> Then the problem started ... K - cup prices sky@@ rock@@ eted ...
<n> I &apos; m a su@@ cker .
<n> It was broken when I received it .
<n> : I must say that I absolutely h@@ ated this story .
<n> This book was so conf@@ using I don &apos; t even know what the story is really about .
<n> : More American Gra@@ ff@@ iti is kind of sad to me .
<n> It &apos; s sad that Terr@@ y the to@@ ad &apos; s gir@@ l@@ friend for@@ gets him and becomes a hi@@ pp@@ ie .
<n> The ending is the most sad because you know John Mil@@ ner is about to die because of a dr@@ unk driver .
<n> I probably w@@ ouldn &apos; t recommend M@@ ORE AM@@ ER@@ IC@@ AN G@@ RA@@ FF@@ IT@@ I !@@ !
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble reception : I had this h@@ oo@@ ked up with digital cable .
<n> It is an emergency .
<n> It is the problem .
<n> I have never been able to charge it because of a def@@ ective char@@ ger .
<n> They want me to pay full post@@ age to send back the def@@ ective char@@ ger .
<n> Ten Days That Sh@@ ook the World : I read a lot of history books and I just found this very bor@@ ing .
<n> SK &apos; s worst ever , really 0 stars : I h@@ ated it .
<n> Bad plot , poor@@ ly delivered , terrible book .
<n> SK has written some really good books , but this one was so bad I have not read another SK since .
<n> Not His Best : Like many others I am a big fan of Stephen King .
<n> . This book is really , really bad .
<n> I am a big King fan , but I cannot in good conscience rec@@ commend this book .
<n> He &apos; s lost his touch .
<n> I so wanted to like this book , but it &apos; s bad , really bad .
<n> I was disappointed in this one , however .
<n> The squ@@ ee@@ ze portion broke immediately and I was never able to use it .
<n> I am very disappointed .
<n> I assume the product was old , but under any circumstances it was def@@ ective .
<n> The recommended dose thre@@ w me into a det@@ ox that was ut@@ terly mis@@ er@@ able and la@@ sted for weeks .
<n> It took me a while to put two and two together as I just thought I was sick .
<n> Po@@ or tap@@ ing quality , poor instructions , poor everything !
<n> Unfortunately I received the same book .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble movie .
<n> : After viewing for about 10 minutes , I noticed a dis@@ agre@@ eable od@@ or being em@@ itted from the disc .
<n> It wasn &apos; t the disc , it was that stup@@ id movie .
<n> no no no no NO !@@ !
<n> : A@@ void this film at all costs !
<n> Who the hell green - ligh@@ ted this effects - laden dun@@ gh@@ e@@ ap ?
<n> how might it suddenly spring to life and kill someone ?
<n> Bel@@ ongs on M@@ ST@@ 3@@ K : This was possibly the worst movie I have seen in a long time .
<n> Exp@@ ect a weak plot and a poor computer generated setting lac@@ ed with general in@@ accur@@ acies .
<n> It was quite violent at times and too many people died .
<n> ) where used in this worth@@ less Rem@@ ake !
<n> I tried to wa@@ de through it but it was so ga@@ w@@ d - aw@@ ful bor@@ ing that I just gave up .
<n> Not happy at all with this .
<n> Po@@ or quality : After first time worn it turned color .
<n> Very poor d@@ eign .

<n> This book is quite possibly the worst text@@ book I have ever encountered .
<n> Otherwise , she is NOT interested .
<n> The plastic of the packaging will stab or sli@@ ce you .
<n> They are just plain f@@ akes .
<n> They are just plain f@@ ake !
<n> Do@@ ing bad business : The product did not show up on time .
<n> It is just bad business and I am shopping elsewhere .

<n> The worst part is they made Mrs . Fair@@ fax the bad guy in this book .
<n> Con@@ f@@ used ?
<n> It was a place of terror that held to many memories that ha@@ un@@ ted people .
<n> Mis@@ leading and disappointing .
<n> h@@ ein@@ ous : This is the most terrible , emo@@ tionally offensive film ever created .
<n> Hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous : Any@@ body that would sit through something so stup@@ id like this movie should be shot .
<n> Sup@@ posedly I had a &quot; fixed &quot; unit though , but it failed to work .
<n> Not a good fit : The t@@ ent seems to be good .
<n> But the tunnel does not fit well into the t@@ ent .
<n> Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow !
<n> A ridicul@@ ous pair of un@@ car@@ ing parents essentially abandon their daughter to wh@@ om@@ ever comes along .
<n> It su@@ cks !
<n> My daughter is about 1 year old and this product is not very good for a baby learning to walk .
<n> Could have caused a serious injury had I not been right there .
<n> I can &apos; t tell you how many times the to@@ y fli@@ pped over and she was h@@ urt and cr@@ ying h@@ yst@@ er@@ ically !
<n> Not U@@ se@@ ful as a Wal@@ ker for all Children : My child could not use this as a wal@@ ker .
<n> A@@ W@@ F@@ U@@ L : Just hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> There was no back to this case at all .@@ !@@ !
<n> Dis@@ gu@@ sting !
<n> This just destro@@ ys any connection with the songs .
<n> The rest is ok@@ ay but not great .
<n> This makes it extremely difficult to follow convers@@ ations in the book .
<n> So I was completely di@@ stra@@ c@@ ted from the actual content of the book .
<n> H@@ ated It !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> I w@@ ouldn &apos; t recommend this c@@ d !
<n> Not my son &apos; s favorite : My friends recommended this product , but we had a bad experience with it .
<n> First of all , the bub@@ ble setting makes a rather loud noise and my son had trouble falling as@@ le@@ ep .
<n> It was not the best investment for us .
<n> I am so disappointed its un@@ real !@@ !
<n> So when it turns off he just starts to c@@ ry because he has@@ n &apos; t figur@@ ed out how to turn it on again .
<n> An aw@@ ful text@@ book !
<n> : This was one of the worst text@@ books I &apos; ve ever read .
<n> It d@@ ron@@ es on in exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating detail for pages before finally stating the main point or idea .
<n> It is a very frustr@@ ating read .
<n> Wa@@ ste of money : This book is not cra@@ m at all .
<n> It is waste of money .
<n> A@@ void buying this product !
<n> : I read the user review somewhere else and I ignored them .
<n> What a f@@ ool I was .
<n> not easy set - up : The instructions say that it is easy set - up .
<n> However , it is very difficult to get the pol@@ es into the correct place to set the t@@ ent up .
<n> if you leave the sha@@ ke sitting for too long it tastes gross !
<n> When I went back to my sha@@ ke it ta@@ sted really bad !
<n> I hope it really works out for other people , but s@@ adly this product just wasn &apos; t for me .
<n> F@@ AK@@ E PRO@@ D@@ UC@@ T !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> It &apos; s f@@ ake and won &apos; t buy it again .
<n> Clu@@ eless !@@ !
<n> The Ash@@ en Th@@ ief : I got dis@@ sa@@ pointed with this book .
<n> Len@@ tic@@ ular Ri@@ p off Do not get O@@ UT FO@@ X@@ ED : This is a dis@@ grace Len@@ tic@@ ular means a different box cover .
<n> Power Jack@@ ed : I bought it in January 2004 and the power jack went bad in January 2006 .
<n> I am sorry to here about your broken equipment , Mr . Steve .
<n> I &apos; m sorry , but it seems I can not help you .
<n> After failing twice , I bought the Sy@@ be@@ x books and passed after a fast read .
<n> TH@@ IS BO@@ OK W@@ IL@@ L IN NO W@@ A@@ Y P@@ RE@@ P@@ ARE YOU TO P@@ AS@@ S THE EX@@ AM@@ S !
<n> Bad news : content .
<n> Too bad MS@@ Press didn &apos; t consult M@@ CP ( or that person ) before designing the book cover .
<n> Good overview maybe , but for passing tests , NO W@@ A@@ Y !
<n> Hu@@ ge Dis@@ appointment !
<n> : I thought this book was slow and bor@@ ing .
<n> The characters w@@ re not well developed and I didn &apos; t like the author &apos; s writing style .
<n> A bitter woman , a cu@@ ck@@ ol@@ ded husband , and a negl@@ ected daughter .
<n> Is she alive , or dead ?
<n> Dis@@ appointed : I was really disappointed in this purchase .
<n> It is not a good choice for a Y@@ oga class .
<n> More disappointing is that I can &apos; t return it .
<n> It was a complete di@@ stra@@ ction from the characters and plot .
<n> Mag@@ ical M@@ yst@@ ery Tour : Hor@@ ns , fl@@ utes , instru@@ ment@@ als and bad voc@@ als .
<n> The only thing that su@@ cks with this vacuum is the fact that I paid $ 90 bu@@ cks for it !
<n> The part of the plastic connection that holds the cap was broken ( opened it only a few times )@@ .
<n> Another problem : if you run one side of the main floor unit under a narrow ri@@ m , i . e .
<n> It has su@@ cked since day 1 .
<n> H@@ ate it .
<n> It doesn &apos; t pick up dog hair very well and after emp@@ t@@ ying , it &apos; s a pain to get back together .
<n> Po@@ or Quality construction : I purchased this for my 7 year old .
<n> This product is very low quality .
<n> The wheels have fallen off the cars .
<n> Bro@@ ken !
<n> I am glad I also purchased a stro@@ be light or the kids would have been so disappointed !
<n> A broken item was sent : I received a broken item from the seller .
<n> The real problem I had was the bul@@ b wasn &apos; t turning on THE F@@ IR@@ ST T@@ IM@@ E I tried it .
<n> The rot@@ ating ball is working so I figur@@ ed out I just got a broken bul@@ b .
<n> Now I have this in my garage , us@@ eless
<n> Just as those movies st@@ unk , so does this one .
<n> I am in shock that a movie whose cover looked so ti@@ till@@ ating could be such a disappointment .
<n> It is really nice to hear a story about someone who recover@@ ed from tragedy .
<n> Kompl@@ ete M@@ ess : This is a TER@@ R@@ IB@@ LE version of Mor@@ tal Kom@@ bat 4 !
<n> Ac@@ tually , it may even be worse than M@@ K@@ 3 !
<n> A@@ void this at all costs !
<n> And just when you thought Gre@@ ase 2 was as bad as it gets .
<n> This is worse !
<n> It was a vali@@ ant effort but sometimes you just wanted to scre@@ am as it went on and on and on and on .
<n> It just was not very good to me as I tried to watch it .
<n> J@@ M@@ HO and no dis@@ respect intended .
<n> B@@ oring : This movie is totally bor@@ ing .
<n> What was so bad about it ?
<n> Tot@@ ally bl@@ ah : This was a very un@@ interesting waste of time .
<n> This title is misleading .
<n> I was wrong !
<n> This game is not thri@@ lling and it just doesn &apos; t seem to have a point .
<n> I sold mine because it was just us@@ eless to me .
<n> S@@ low moving , te@@ di@@ ously bor@@ ing and with a plot that is never expl@@ ored .
<n> It has a slow bor@@ ing beat and air@@ y , ech@@ o@@ ing voc@@ als .
<n> Also , this single also includes &quot; Call &@@ quot@@ ;@@ , her album &apos; s W@@ OR@@ ST track .
<n> : I h@@ ated it .
<n> poor life cycle - not a smart buy : We bought this in 4 / 09 and gave it VER@@ Y moderate use .
<n> : Ter@@ ri@@ ble , terrible , just terrible !
<n> I read it first and the movie was an un@@ mitig@@ ated failure and disappointment to me .
<n> I could just c@@ ry thinking about it .
<n> Wor@@ st .
<n> : This really is the worst Econom@@ ics text@@ book I have ever encountered .
<n> The book even resorts to bad gramm@@ er and poor editing in places .
<n> The g@@ ist I also got from this story is that they &apos; re distant relatives , gross@@ ness !
<n> Plus Sil@@ as is eg@@ oti@@ s@@ tical and way too pus@@ h@@ y .
<n> In this sequ@@ el , we are following the path of the younger brother of the k@@ iller in the first movie .
<n> bad acting , nu@@ dity , sex , killing , blood , etc .
<n> B@@ AD MO@@ VI@@ E : My friend and i were looking for a bad hor@@ ror movie , and we found it .
<n> The story is stup@@ id .
<n> A@@ w@@ ful : This book just isn &apos; t worth it .
<n> But I just don &apos; t care any more . Security pul@@ ls g@@ uns on Bar@@ ney at the airport but he has no reaction ?
<n> How stup@@ id . I haven &apos; t lau@@ gh@@ ed with this show for a LON@@ G time .
<n> it &apos; s just a bad movie .
<n> je@@ al@@ ous@@ y ?
<n> After crus@@ hing only 4 .... yes 4 cans it sn@@ apped in two .
<n> I was very disappointed .
<n> The story was wo@@ eful .
<n> This is my quiet warning .
<n> The quality is worse than if I had printed it on &quot; fast draft &quot; on my ink@@ jet printer .
<n> I would rather sc@@ rap@@ e : I don@@ t care for this item .
<n> The l@@ ame observations of an un@@ f@@ unny man .
<n> : I &apos; ll keep this short since I &apos; ve already wast@@ ed enough time reading this gar@@ b@@ age .
<n> However , there isn &apos; t a single f@@ unny line in this entire book .
<n> Can you say bor@@ ing three times fast ?
<n> : This book is a complete waste of time .
<n> : Gar@@ min and F@@ od@@ ors should be ash@@ amed of this product .
<n> Ter@@ ri@@ ble quality control .
<n> A defect like this is totally unacceptable , especially on a Le@@ a@@ ther@@ man that costs over $ 100 .
<n> I am very disappointed and will be returning this tool immediately .
<n> The die cast trucks are what you would expect for the price .
<n> Or because the re@@ mix@@ es were not re@@ mot@@ ely as good as expected ?
<n> What a disappointment !
<n> But this game is B@@ Y FA@@ R the worst game cu@@ be game I &apos; ve played .
<n> How could I have known that I would be in for a ru@@ de aw@@ ak@@ ening .
<n> I was maj@@ or@@ ly disappointed .
<n> The stor@@ y@@ line moved too fast and I really wasn &apos; t that f@@ ond of j@@ ada by the end of the book .
<n> K@@ im@@ i is dis@@ gu@@ sting : She is a little pos@@ er !@@ !@@ !
<n> K@@ im@@ i is the most gross and ir@@ rit@@ ating of the bab@@ ies .
<n> Also , those stup@@ id little co@@ w@@ boy bo@@ ots .
<n> She really su@@ cks .
<n> Ap@@ proxim@@ ately 75 errors were encountered .
<n> B@@ OR@@ ING RE@@ V@@ E@@ AN@@ GE G@@ H@@ OS@@ T MO@@ VI@@ E !
<n> the &quot; killing &quot; scenes are quite lau@@ gh@@ able considering ALL the hor@@ ror movies i have seen !
<n> The game is too complicated and there were tons of gli@@ t@@ ches and i h@@ ated it .
<n> Book 5 was hor@@ ri@@ ble , but Lord of Chaos ( book 6 ) was another fine install@@ ment .
<n> Robert Jordan should have been embar@@ rass@@ ed to have ever seen this mon@@ stro@@ sity go to print .
<n> AR@@ R@@ G@@ G@@ H@@ H@@ H@@ H@@ H@@ H@@ H@@ H@@ H@@ H@@ H@@ H@@ H : At least I see that there are other readers as frustr@@ ated as I am .
<n> What started out as an ep@@ ic , has become drawn out and almost painful to read .
<n> R@@ ent before you Bu@@ y : What a bad movie .
<n> You might as well call V@@ in Dies@@ el &apos; s career dead or on the same level as Se@@ ag@@ al and Van D@@ amme .
<n> Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , I did not finish this book -- didn &apos; t even care who d@@ unit .
<n> The main conflict of the movie is that Me@@ g Ry@@ an &apos; s husband gets kid@@ n@@ apped by gor@@ ill@@ as .
<n> Throughout the movie he is ab@@ used , denied of a s@@ have or a shower , and is put to rot@@ ten work .
<n> At the same time there is a sexual tension bre@@ wing between Me@@ g Ry@@ an and Rus@@ sell Cro@@ we .
<n> It was almost as bad as &quot; The Saint .@@ &quot;
<n> The cover art is beautiful , but the rest inside it really su@@ cks .
<n> It st@@ in@@ ks : All of the spo@@ ok@@ y characters of the original Sher@@ lock Hol@@ mes , but none of the charm .
<n> Po@@ or DVD quality : I love this movie but the quality of the DVD is very poor .
<n> towards the end the DVD stops and starts several times which is very anno@@ ying .
<n> It was hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> It was long , bor@@ ing , and point@@ less .
<n> B@@ OR@@ ING , B@@ AD AC@@ T@@ ING , NOT RE@@ AL@@ IST@@ IC , A@@ W@@ F@@ U@@ L : This movie is not worth seeing .
<n> Don &apos; t let the packaging f@@ ool you !
<n> You don &apos; t want to see it , you have to turn for@@ c@@ efully away , and if you do see it it will ha@@ unt you .
<n> Turkey Rather Th@@ an One Star :@@ : What &apos; s wrong with Hollywood ?
<n> It was largely what I expected - fairly worth@@ less .
<n> Help your Do@@ g Fi@@ ght Canc@@ er : This is the most informative book I &apos; ve ever read on the subject .
<n> It was so bad , I left the theater 20 minutes into it .
<n> But this is so ut@@ terly d@@ ull , un@@ interesting , bor@@ ing , and idi@@ otic , that I couldn &apos; t even watch it .
<n> The acting is aw@@ ful and so is the writing .
<n> Why sit around and watch j@@ unk , you will thank me later that you passed this stup@@ id movie up .
<n> Even his most recent movie was a fl@@ op .
<n> I consider a fl@@ op when you experience &quot; forced lau@@ ghter &@@ quot@@ ;@@ .
<n> War@@ ped t@@ ale should get lost and stay there : Sh@@ ort At@@ tention Sp@@ an Sum@@ m@@ ary ( S@@ AS@@ S )@@ : 1 .
<n> Bad di@@ alo@@ gu@@ e@@ 2 .
<n> Bad act@@ ing@@ 3 .
<n> Bad scri@@ pt@@ 4 .
<n> But anyone with more than half a brain is likely to consider this movie really dum@@ b .
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> Absol@@ ut@@ ly hor@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> Wor@@ st movie ever !
<n> : Hor@@ ri@@ ble , stup@@ id , its Will Fer@@ ri@@ l &apos; s best yet !
<n> This was the D@@ UM@@ B@@ EST movie we have EV@@ ER seen ( even worse than Freedom State )@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> Will Fer@@ ri@@ l is an amaz@@ ingly stup@@ id actor .
<n> It su@@ cks .
<n> Under@@ stand its danger and the sh@@ allow nature that this word con@@ notes .
<n> I now understand why there have been so few j@@ ou@@ sting movies out , because it &apos; s bor@@ ing .
<n> This movie is acted hor@@ ri@@ bly , written hor@@ ri@@ bly , and directed hor@@ ri@@ bly .
<n> Ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous !
<n> : This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen .
<n> He@@ ath L@@ ed@@ ger , as a lead actor , is terrible .
<n> In fact , all the actors in this movie are extremely bad .
<n> The story is poor and ridicul@@ ous .
<n> Gi@@ ve your money to a char@@ ity or pay off an old debt and avoid this rub@@ b@@ ish .
<n> How can you make a hor@@ ror movie that is so ut@@ terly de@@ void of susp@@ ence ?
<n> : Your typical , average , un@@ original m@@ asked man killing off people that he doesn &apos; t like .
<n> That don &apos; t love him .
<n> This whole things has been done to death and I &apos; m sick of it .
<n> SC@@ RE@@ AM 25 .
<n> SC@@ RE@@ AM 36 .
<n> Tom Sav@@ age should sue : This is possibly the worst book to movie transition I have ever seen .
<n> I urge everyone who saw this movie and h@@ ated it as much as I did to read the book .
<n> This game su@@ cks : Yes , the graphics are goods but this game su@@ cks big time .
<n> No statistics or ro@@ ster changes !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> Why even bo@@ ther ?@@ ?@@ ?
<n> a very disappointing movie .
<n> what a big disappointment .
<n> Su@@ cked : Some f@@ unny parts here and there , but mostly su@@ cked .
<n> ) tr@@ ite dialogue , idi@@ otic plot .
<n> Fru@@ str@@ ating and ineffective .
<n> : I find this ch@@ op@@ per to be frustr@@ ating and ineffective .
<n> I was not happy with the product .
<n> The worst ch@@ op@@ per I have ever used , from the first use !
<n> M@@ VP bas@@ eb@@ al su@@ cks with the college players so don &apos; t buy that either .
<n> The con@@ spi@@ racy plot is lau@@ gh@@ able .
<n> Kev@@ in Cost@@ ner is aw@@ ful as Gar@@ ris@@ on .
<n> D@@ um@@ b As H@@ ell , But Wat@@ ch@@ able : Sol@@ di@@ er is one of those films that was just made to be po@@ ked fun at .
<n> : My experience with this device was hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> Simply disappointing !
<n> I don &apos; t recommend this album to anyone !
<n> W@@ ast@@ ed money !
<n> Any@@ way , Jar@@ re@@ au &apos; s voice sounds simply mur@@ ky and bor@@ ing .
<n> really the worst .
<n> Do not make the same mistake I made of buying it , it is not worth even 10 $@@ !
<n> I wast@@ ed money on this ridicul@@ ous program , shame on Be@@ ach@@ Bo@@ dy for rel@@ easing this !
<n> The result was a sti@@ cky m@@ ess that could barely be corrected by adding more and more flo@@ ur .
<n> Too bad .
<n> bor@@ ed to death : at school last week we wat@@ ched this movie , history class .
<n> I learned not@@ ing and only was dis@@ gu@@ sted R@@ ENT TH@@ IS F@@ IR@@ ST , PO
<n> Not Buddh@@ ist , not P@@ ag@@ an & certainly NOT G@@ no@@ stic ( she@@ esh !
<n> O@@ h - and the actual ly@@ ric in the word bal@@ lo@@ on is wrong too .
<n> This film is cut and cens@@ ored .
<n> David W@@ ay@@ ne &apos; s portra@@ yal of a self - absor@@ bed , cru@@ el det@@ ached husband is o . k .
<n> Star Trek : G@@ ate@@ ways Book One - One Small St@@ ep : This is getting totally pi@@ tiful .
<n> Pocket Books is making a big mistake .
<n> If we do , we should be ash@@ amed of ourselves ! U@@ tter tri@@ pe .
<n> cru@@ m@@ my cru@@ m@@ my cru@@ m@@ my : this is the worst movie i have ever seen !
<n> i turned it off it was so bad !
<n> O@@ uch This Mo@@ vie Hur@@ ts : I had to write this review to counter@@ balance all the fak@@ ed 5 star reviews .
<n> Out@@ side of that this movie is a train w@@ rec@@ k .
<n> The plot is a waste of time .
<n> The only way people might like this is in its so bad its a cul@@ t classic thing .
<n> I was tra@@ pped !
<n> The only problem with the Pen@@ gu@@ in edition is that it &apos; s gross@@ ly over - ann@@ ot@@ ated .
<n> In the Rab@@ bit H@@ ole : This is not a pretty edition .
<n> The printing is den@@ se and the quality of the paper is poor .
<n> Not for a gift .
<n> One of the worst movies I have ever seen : Defin@@ itely in the bottom five .
<n> bor@@ ing : Mo@@ vie was very bor@@ ing , not what i expected .
<n> Deli@@ very to the following recip@@ i@@ ents failed .
<n> My worst experience as Client ....
<n> Not the greatest buy .
<n> I am very disappointed .
<n> You can learn more from a bad James B@@ ond movie .
<n> All I have to say is it was the biggest waste of money I &apos; ve ever spent .
<n> This movie was terrible .
<n> The movie was supposed to be a com@@ edy , but there was nothing f@@ unny about it .
<n> We were so bor@@ ed that we didn &apos; t even finish it .
<n> We had to turn it off it was too terrible to finish .
<n> Whatever you do don &apos; t put yourself through the torture of having to see this movie .
<n> The entire book left me wanting to know more , but not giving me a whole lot I didn &apos; t already know .
<n> At this point , I &apos; m not impressed .
<n> Wor@@ st movie ever : The acting and the script for this a@@ Al@@ fred Hit@@ ch@@ cock movie are hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> No dis@@ respect to Pr@@ y@@ so@@ ck , but you &apos; ll never listen to it the same way again !
<n> Beyond th@@ et its as worth@@ less as Ke@@ aton &apos; s cheap short films ( of which there are two on this DVD )@@ .
<n> Why did anybody think so many would want to warm up to this loser of an actor called Bu@@ ster ?
<n> DO@@ ES NOT W@@ ORK , D@@ ON &apos; T W@@ AS@@ TE YO@@ UR M@@ ON@@ E@@ Y : This products is terrible and ineffective .
<n> Get the pan@@ try mo@@ th tra@@ p in the red and yellow pack .
<n> When I put this product out on my counter , the mo@@ ths looked a little da@@ zed and confused .
<n> Most fle@@ w near the tra@@ p , but less than 10 percent got inside the tra@@ p , near the sti@@ cky part .
<n> I also tried placing the tra@@ p inside the cab@@ inet ( with everything removed ) with similar results .
<n> The sti@@ cky adhes@@ ive missed most of the mo@@ ths !@@ !
<n> I actually tra@@ pped a mo@@ th in the tri@@ angle and it hit the sides of the tra@@ p -- nothing !
<n> It &apos; s very frustr@@ ating to be out the money for these tra@@ ps since they don &apos; t seem to be working .
<n> It &apos; s even more frustr@@ ating to see the mo@@ ths still flying around .
<n> If only I could vote &quot; 0 Stars &@@ quot@@ ;@@ : I am continually disappointed in Bo@@ y George .
<n> He has such potential , yet puts out what is in my opinion , pure cra@@ p .
<n> The songs on this album are d@@ read@@ ful .
<n> If you do not believe me , purchase this DVD then purchase the The E@@ ag@@ les - H@@ ell Free@@ zes Over .
<n> This was wa@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ ay too specific for me and not helpful in my case .
<n> : the tape was in poor condition that had stre@@ aks through some of the tape .
<n> Cas@@ ab@@ lan@@ ca : My disc is bad ; It would not get past the 8th scene .
<n> : I h@@ ate this movie .
<n> Its not even a movie , more of a waste of time .
<n> I &apos; ve wast@@ ing too much time writing this review already .
<n> It doesn &apos; t even qualify as bad or hor@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> rot@@ ten am@@ er@@ ic@@ ans .
<n> cor@@ rupt movie used by se@@ duc@@ ing spir@@ its ( demon@@ s ) to lead the world to hell .
<n> Too much re@@ ven@@ ge .
<n> This movie Su@@ cks .
<n> Direc@@ tions are A@@ W@@ F@@ U@@ L : Or@@ dered this based on the product name .
<n> The directions are hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous and make no sense .
<n> I would NOT recommend this item !
<n> It &apos; s a piece of cra@@ p .
<n> Sounds a little too much like a sc@@ am to me .
<n> For one , the chrom@@ atic ab@@ ber@@ ation at the long end was terrible when the image was viewed at 100 %@@ .
<n> a mul@@ lig@@ an : P@@ utting the sti@@ ck@@ ers on the cover was a wick@@ ed b@@ last .
<n> I am very dis@@ gu@@ sted with the whole business .
<n> It &apos; s too bad .
<n> worst movie ever !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !@@ !
<n> Un@@ satisfied : I am not satisfied with the item i purchased from you .
<n> I will not play and constantly stops and free@@ zes up .
<n> Problem is , too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost go@@ sp@@ el .
<n> But I learned some stuff that doesn &apos; t make me respect him as a person .
<n> One of the most bor@@ ing movies ever !
<n> However , the tape transfer is hor@@ ri@@ ble .
<n> Also , shame on the publish@@ er for the cra@@ pp@@ y form@@ at@@ ting .
<n> The album is som@@ ber .
<n> ( no p@@ un intended ) You see them 20 seconds later when she gets stran@@ g@@ led on the phone so WT@@ F !
<n> This is the second worst movie I &apos; ve ever seen ( the worst is Friday The 13th )@@ .
<n> If you want something sc@@ ary go buy The Am@@ ity@@ ville Hor@@ ror , that movie is good .
<n> This su@@ cks ..@@ .@@ : This is the worst movie of all time .
<n> It was just way to sc@@ ary .
<n> Po@@ or DVD transfer : The transfer to DVD is very poor ( worse I have seen yet )@@ .
<n> Plus , Michael My@@ ers is just plain looking , Jas@@ on and Fre@@ d@@ dy are more dead and sc@@ arier than this .
<n> Another thing , the body count was too low !
<n> Jam@@ ie Lee Cur@@ tis was an extremely bad actor , and her voice was just too man@@ ly !
<n> That this version is mark@@ eted and h@@ yp@@ ed is pa@@ thetic .
<n> It was a waste of time .
<n> A Stu@@ dent Per@@ spective : As a student , I have found this book to be a very difficult read .
<n> The USB cor@@ d is too long and comes with an ON / O@@ FF slide switch ( which failed quickly )@@ .
<n> : I have owned 2 Tar@@ g@@ us chill mat@@ s and they were the worst pieces of cra@@ p I ever bought .
<n> Unfortunately , they were the only brand available in my local stores , so I had to settle .
<n> I will never trust Tar@@ g@@ us for any product ever again !@@ !@@ !
<n> bad connection soon after purchase : The design for this is terrible .
<n> A few b@@ umps and the connection inside the p@@ ad becomes f@@ aul@@ ty .
<n> This is very anno@@ ying , and there doesn &apos; t seem to be any simple way to fix it .
<n> Di@@ d@@ n &apos; t know it was so noisy .
<n> Hor@@ ri@@ ble !
<n> bad connection : I own two of these laptop cool@@ ers .
<n> Both have the same problem .
<n> It worked ok@@ ay , but one of the fans constantly stopped working or made a hor@@ ri@@ ble sound .
<n> W@@ OR@@ ST CO@@ OL@@ ING PRO@@ D@@ UC@@ TS EV@@ ER !@@ !
<n> Every one I have had has died within 4 months .
<n> So I just kept either ex@@ changing it for a new one , or buy a new one and return the broken one .
<n> I found the problem to be in the sil@@ ly on / off switch they stuck in the middle of the cable .
<n> Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , I &apos; m not impressed .
<n> Second , the fans are small , so no air is circul@@ ated by these things .
<n> For something with hardly anything to it , that &apos; s sad .
<n> Not happy !
<n> I ordered two and regret it .
<n> Don &apos; t let the f@@ ake picture f@@ ool you , this is a low model of Chi@@ ll Pad and is poor@@ ly designed .
<n> Dis@@ appointing device : I &apos; ve been using the B@@ T@@ 250 for a couple of weeks now .
<n> ( It looks stup@@ id , also .@@ ) 2 .
<n> The 250 is aw@@ k@@ ward to put on your ear , which is a real pain when you &apos; re trying to take a call . 4 .
<n> It was sad .
