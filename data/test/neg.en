The VCR still works , but hte DVD side is useless .
To me that &apos; s a sign on bad quality .
It doesn &apos; t even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now .
The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it .
DVD menu select problems : I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically .
No special features , no language select , nothing , just play .
Very frustrating , and the game absolutely will not work for me .
:( I sent it back .
No one will help me with this problem .
Waste of money !
Three Days of Use and It Broke : Very disappointed in this product .
unlike the &quot; dark &quot; series , you really didnt feel any passion .
A Lost Author : I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date , except one .
I was hoping to find out more about this curse , the origins and why the males kill the females .
Nothing , not a word about the Jaguar curse .
What a shame .
The movie loses it &apos; s true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude &quot; jokes &quot;.
It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior .
Very Disappointing .
I thought the story began well enough , but the ending was lame .
Vastly overrated work of fiction : I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery .
I would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty & irrational .
So , the manufacturer can &apos; t say that I didn &apos; t take good care of it .
CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG : I ordered this product to slim down my stomach .
Not happy : I was really unhappy with this .
nice product : My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size .
She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn &apos; t fit .
There is very little character development , movie - like dialogue , and plenty of mindless action .
but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend ... i didnt like it 2 much but ...
Painful : This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written .
Mistake ?
Nothing truly interesting happens in this book .
: As good as this book may be , the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it .
We &apos; ve all seen the trick , so it &apos; s just not interesting anymore .
one of the worst movies of 2002 : god !!!
what a dumb movie .
very disappointing : The movie is vulgar and not meant for children .
Not enjoyable at all .
If you are still in the grieving stage , this book will not help you .
Really , why even bother ?
Very frustrating .
Very poor quality .
From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead .
This one may have just been a bad example .
I didn &apos; t finish the book , it was a waste of time .
Disturbing .
Not Very good : I dont advise buying this grider , it broken when i pressed it .
Disappointing .
Band saves CD : As usual , Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice .
worst book in the world !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
: This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life !
I was forced to read it for school .
It was complicated and very boring .
I would not recommend this book to anyone !!
I tried to leave feedback for EIDOS , but to no avail .
Delay after delay .
I had one disappointment after another .
I have given up many times in shear frustration .
Frustration I haven &apos; t felt in her other games .
Alas , there is also no index .
a terrible product : this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner .
and the screws didn &apos; t fit well .
i was really disappointed in it .
BUYER BEWARE : This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time .
Software is Horrible !
: This software is not user friendly .
The samples don &apos; t help .
Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store .
Very Disappointing .
Poor quality and high price ... are these knock - offs ?
What a disappointment !
After the Fire is a disappointing read .
What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth - what a weak and stupid woman !
Any mother will fight to the end for her children .
Failed to Work : I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista .
Mathematical nonsense : Mathematically speaking , this book is all nonsense .
For instance , the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning .
But after the first pages , I knew that this was a mistake .
Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time .
Stuck With You : I didn &apos; t really like the book .
lousy , outdated guide , with horrible printing flaws !
broken :(: The base and frame were not completely attached .
Lousy RF range ; ON worked from further away than OFF : The range of use was practically useless .
Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines ?
The retractable cord broke after a short time .
After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on - off button was broken as well !
waste of time and money !!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is a worthless piece of junk !
Do not waste your time on this sub - standard , horribly designed and made product !!!!
: This over - priced pain in &quot; the sitting area &quot; has an always - on , glaring RED light .
* Red lights are commonly used to warn of an immediate danger that requires attention NOW .
* NO - I don &apos; t have a carbon Monoxide problem .
Crap , Junk , Worthless , etc : The other 1 - star poster is absolutely correct ; these things are crap .
It is not true , obviously .
The title is misleading .
Also , the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened ( or dulled , however you look at it ).
I have difficulties cutting through even thin , soft silicone sheets .
Dull and dirty : Well I don &apos; t usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product . 1rst .
No footnotes or primary sources listed for such conclusions ??
I love every other Night World book , but this is retarded .
I was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men ( in black ) behaving badly .
SHAME ON YOU MR . KEEL !!!
: 257 pages covering Men in Black , lights in the sky , and phone troubles .
I had absolutely no clue was was going on in this book .
Just crazy ! Just a few of my favourites :&quot; so horrified she dropped the small baby in her arms .
The child began to cry , more insulted than hurt .&quot;
I &apos; m thinking the kids was more hurt than insulted .
Seriously , the beats her singing is layered over are tired and clich√©d .
Final Verdict : Bad music .
noritake colorwave stoneware : I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company .
Instead , I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever .
Worst book I &apos; ve ever read : This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read .
Search the web for &quot; canon zr users group &quot; and &quot; eating tapes &quot; to hear similar horror stories .
Ehh : The disc is intact but the case is in terrible ocndition .
It is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case .
If this is &quot; true &quot; Nirvana , then &quot; true &quot; Nirvana sucks .
There are quite a few annoying typos .
Expensive experiment that didn &apos; t work : I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use .
Most disappointing .
To see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired .
This edition is disappointingly and , in my humble opinion , unnecessarily small .
Can I shoot myself now ??
: A few years back I was forced to read &quot; Tess &quot; for my English class .
Awful : This was one of the worst books I have ever read .
Cruel and Depressing Story : Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society .
They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending .
I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression .
: Tess was a very boring book .
The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards .
I hated this book then ....: ... and hate it now .
My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult .
Bad purchace .
Ummm : I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it .
Big mistake .
Self Indulgent Nonsense : The operative word from the title is &quot; bums &quot;.
Outlines of Theology , AA Hodge : Kindle edition : Very disappointed .
: I pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for 18 $ but I was so wrong !
Storytelling is like facebooking . Too many plots to cover , horrible pacing , no depth .
: This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see .
I found it to be a total waste of my time .
This movie really sucked !
Horrible : Absolutely rubbish .
Simply not good by any measure .
Every 10 - 15 , the movie would stop and pop up the error message .
Optimus prime getting trapped in a bunch of cables for 20mins of the movie ?
It &apos; s an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film .
Making a movie longer is not making a movie better .
She was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily .
What could possibly go wrong ?
Bad Movie By A Bad Wrestler : Do not bother !
Hell no .
pathetic .
What a complete and utter waste of time , and money .
First off the movie gets started in a crazy action scene / war flashback .
Please avoid this reeking exploding crock of ....
There &apos; s some problem with the program you download from emarker . com .
The program has problems loading the emarker USB drive into your computer .
If I were you , I &apos; d wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems .
How stupid , does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it .
Actually , even if you do have a cable or dsl line , its still useless .
worthless : Where is the space for a zero star !
Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing , I should have read these reviews first .
The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to &quot; enable &quot; itself .
Unfortunately , I didn &apos; t pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn &apos; t work .
I was wrong .
Absolutely ruined it .
Absolutely terrible , the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this .
I am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork .
Disappointed : This video was let down .
Ryan &apos; s Revenge : A surprisingly bad film , painfully slow paced and convoluted .
It really is one hell of a mess .
Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in &quot; best &quot; quality .
An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk .
It has been a waste of money to me -- especially when ink cartridges are so high for it !
I thought this was horrible !
Even a woman with fighting skills .
How utterly stupid !
Foundation is bad .
Not a good book to pick up occasionally , takes a focussed reading .
Stay Away : This just plain bad .
It was a waste of my time .
worst ......... movie ............ ever : Go break open a red light camera and steal the film .
Blu - Ray Review : What a terrible movie , garbage .
It totally sucks .
He now has absolutely NO range .
The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie .
Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble .
The lines were HORRIBLE !
: So he &apos; s a dirty cop and an all around horrible person .
Banal and Boring : No , I &apos; m not making this up .
I was really disappointed , I returned mine ..
If I hadn &apos; t gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money .
What a waste .
awful : Big waste of money !
I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be abusing drugs themselves !
Typos , poor punctuation , etc .
ruined it for me .
Criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound : Don &apos; t buy this Video .
AWFUL : This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read .
It the dullest , most boring thing since I learned algebra .
After the first chapter , I already wanted to kill myself .
The recording is a mess .
The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it .
Very poor quality .
THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING , SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS .
Electric pump failed : Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew .
It was a painful job .
Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE !!
No way !
Batteries run out or lose power after 3 - 4 uses .
Second , it hurts your clitoris .
Awful : This was much bigger then I had anticipated , that being my own fault .
But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt !
The bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable .
So my man suggested I turn it around and then my taint became irritated !
Not one bit pleased with this product .
I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable .
Awful !
HATE IT !
Let me tell you , I was NOT IMPRESSED !
What a waste !
Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks !
Confused : I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter .
Oh Romeo : Stupid teenagers .
And poor communication .
The layout is ugly .
So here goes : Kevin Sorbo , while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear !
So ...... a lost sale for this company .
Disappointed !
It fails miserably there !
MANSON HATES EMMONS .
The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his &apos; friend &apos;.
Everybody distorts everything he has ever said .
Struggled Through !
: I struggled through this book .
The storyline was a bore !
I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended , but too was I disappointed .
This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying .
However , this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years .
If you are considering purchasing it ... don &apos; t ... you &apos; ll save your self some money and frustration .
Worst scanner I &apos; ve owned .
: I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year .
The picture quality is horrible .
Complete and utter waste of my time .
Poor substitute for an iPod : Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod .
Yet another broken headphone jack .
: After roughly a year of fairly reliable use , I &apos; ve also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack .
Not very well written due to being too wordy , hard to follow .
What a waste of time and money .
I think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse !
Thats where trouble came .
I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player .
Worst mp3 player on the market .
This is about the worst mp3 player on the market .
I cannot create or save any playlists .
The worst aspect of this player is the battery life .
Also the menus can be a bit sluggish .
Worthless .
Found the language a bit much to wade through a second time , and not as funny .
What a waste : Complete waste of $ 12 . 00 .
The Jabra Ear Gels are an absolute waste .
So this product fails and had I &apos; d seen them in person I wouldn &apos; t have spent my money on them .
Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset .
It was useless .
Everything was horrible to my opinion .
So two stars for two stars thrown by ugly T
Very BORING : This movie was very boaring .
I really didnt enjoy it at all .
I just dont enjoy when people kill .
I really dont enjoy things like that others might .
The white whale isn &apos; t : The annimation for the white whale was lousy .
The attempt to give underwater scenes with the white whale sending the ship to the bottom stunk .
Waste of time and money : I have used this product in addition to the fogger and carpet powder .
It is a major waste of time and money .
This movie is an absolute insult !
It would have be a waste of electricity and my VCR .
Except worse !
very much disappointed : It was just terrible for me , living in Italy for many years now .
I hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of Italian men .
it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View .
What a disappointing story ! The story had no sense of direction .
All in all , the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character .
under the Tuscany Sun : Was Very Very disappointed !!
Way way too much PC madness . A waste of time and money .
A failure of &quot; Battlefield Earth &quot; proportions !
: I should say , &quot; worse than Battlefield Earth proportions !&quot;
TERRIBLE MOVIE !
: This movie was one of the worst films I &apos; ve seen in years .
Horrible .
For Yu - Gi - Oh fans , you should try buying Yu - Gi - Oh tins instead of this CRAP !
dont get it : Dont get it the graphics suck and u can only get mega man .
Not a good toy : This toy isn &apos; t well made or designed with kids in mind .
The characters are boring and flat .
His humor is downright stupid .
This book is not clever in the least .
Boring plot .
What I didn &apos; t like was the plot , it just bored me .
Terrible !
I suffered the undue consequences of going off &quot; cold turkey &quot; when I needed to taper off .
! If you want the facts ( as boring as they are ) -- dont rely on this book .
I was wrong .
Why didn &apos; t we know of Mrs . Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father ?
My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6 - 10 to understand .
Kids can battle each other .
No way . It isn &apos; t that great outdoor neither .
Very disappointing .
static central : Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static .
Freud is crazy !
Amazon . com sent wrong size : Amazon . com sent the wrong size engine oil cooler than what I ordered .
It &apos; s still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it .
It has the worst ending ever !
It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it .
ASIDE : DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE !
I am always a sucker for a remaster , so decided what the heck .
No drawings !
Old - School Bore Metal : This album offers nothing new or exciting to the genre of metal .
Just dumb , dumb , dumb .
Do not order from Ritz Camera - wrong item : Do not order this item and expect to get what you see .
Flyboys : Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong .
In execution , it is a disappointment .
Sappy and Stupid : This is a very bad movie .
Bad music , bad acting , bad special effects .
getting tired of the cliche : Just another one of those movies .
later on his album came along , his vocals destroy his tracks , literally .
Disappointing .
raydiation : Thank God he stopped rapping , but now this album sucks too !
He &apos; s reppin &apos; Cali too - oh hell no !
Exasperating and annoying .
But after a half dozen chapters , I still couldn &apos; t care less about Tim .
For better writing and deeper analysis about the 96 tragedy , stick to the other 2 books .
: This book is a total waste of time to read .
Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick .
If you &apos; re not familiar with this band , this probably wouldn &apos; t be the best album to start with .
terrible : Unable to use on my television .
1984 : 1984 over all is a very boring book .
George had a good idea but the book really stunk .
I hated the book so much that I forgot her name .
It is twice as worse as 1984 .
If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing , check this out .
1984 : I thought it was a very dull and cheesy book .
I won &apos; t comment on the light , since I wasn &apos; t interested it that option .
:\: If I could give this a negative rating I would .
Waste of money : I bought this for our first long trip with the baby .
It was a waste of money and time .
a boring bloody mess .
: shame on me for buying it .
shame on me for reading it .
I HATE THIS BOOK : I thought this was the worst book I ever read .
There was no point and way to confusing .
i hated reading this !
This book is very difficult to read .
Didn &apos; t Like it !!
: Confusing , disturbing , and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book .
Ray Bradbury reads it , and it is very bad .
It was so painful to listen to his voice I had to turn it off .
It deserves negative 1000 stars .
This was the WORST book I have ever read .
The book moved to slow , and the characters are stupid .
Guy Montag , the main character , is a fireman who sets books on fire , becuase homes are fireproof .
Hardly even deserves 1 star : This is definitely one of the WORST books I have ever come across .
I almost fell asleep during the forword , I dont know how I survived the book .
The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace .
Bleak , Blind , and Boring .
: Being forced to read it in school for its &quot; so called &quot; relation to censorship ( sp ?)
Althoughthe book is about censorship and why / how it is wrong I can &apos; t say much good about it .
First off , everyone in the country is an idiot .
As I read this book , I got more and more confused .
Sadly a disappointment : Perhaps it is dated .
poor reading : I bought this book on tape as read by the author .
It is excruciating to listen to .
I have no idesa just how in the world a book this horrible could have stayed around for 40 years !!!
I have talked to everyone I know and they all read the first 5 pages and immeadiatly hated it .
After reading the first few pages I was completely lost .
Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic .
Definetly not the greatest book in the world .
Personally , I hated the book .
WASTE OF MY TIME : first of all i was assigned to read this book for a class .
it started out lame .
and all it did was get worse .
This is the lamest book I have ever read : This book really sucks .
It makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time .
Weird Weird Weird Weird !!!!!!
: This book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring !
It just stopped , I guess to end the boredom .
Not so good : It works .
So no , this was not a good purchase , and I do not trust the source .
battle weary : This game is horrible .
The battles are so ... long , slow and unexciting .
Horrible Game : This game is boring .
The fight scenes take too long and they are also boring .
Ive played all three and the Fellowship is by far the worst game i have !
DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A WASTE OF MONEY !!!
After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing .
The secondary characters problems just brought the book down further .
NO AVAILABILITY : My rating is for Amazon , not the product .
Very disappointing
Warning .
I HIGHLY don &apos; t recommend this set !
If they did , they would correctly assume that I am , in fact , a pompous erudite fool .
But guess what ?-- I don &apos; t care and I &apos; ll never actually read any of your responses .
Why ? What the hell is going on with Finnegans Wake ???
Unfortunately , the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies .
I tried contacting them , but no response .
Sad , since I was looking forward to reading this , based on the jacket copy .
At the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds .
Disappointing : This was a very disappointing purchase .
Absolute Crap !
A Truley Horrible Horror Film : A truly horrible horror film .
Catherine Zeta - Jones trap !
: Is &quot; The House On Haunted Hill &quot; so different than &quot; The Haunting &quot;?
... and what a feeble haunting it is !
: No , no , no !
What went wrong ?
Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson also try to add flavour to it all , but cannot manage to save the day .
And the eerie mood is almost totally absent .
Not a good omen for a &quot; horror &quot; movie , is it ? I just can &apos; t believe what went wrong for Neeson .
: Sad Sad SadThe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs .
Hes a great actor , but was very weak in this movie .
There was maybe one scary part , which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump .
I dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies , b / c it was a polar opposite .
It was worse .
They &apos; re just annoying .
Zeta - Jones &apos; s leather hipboots manage to out - act her , and Lili Taylor is hilariously bad as Eleanor .
Liam Neeson is even less interesting than he was in THE PHANTOM MENACE , if that &apos; s possible .
Shame on me .
EMBARASSINGLY BAD : This is the worst film of all time .
Sadly Disappointing : This overdone remake of the brilliant 1963 classic is sorely disappointing .
If you want some innovative horror from 1999 , I suggest you get &quot; The Blair Witch Project &quot;.
I wanted to use it for a wkend trip I was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was .
The card works fine on my PC , but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam .
Too Boring to Continue : I only made it to 195 pages .
The book is just boring .
A lot of sound and fury signifying very little .
BUT -- I don &apos; t care about the characters .
If you don &apos; t care about the characters , then all their quirky faults seem abstract and dull .
Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good .
I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page .
Could never read this book ....: This is what I think my problem is ...
I &apos; ll second that : I nearly cried when I realized that this was an abridged version .
Terrible product , did not work , and company unreachable .
I followed all the terrible instructions , and it still did not work .
It is the second of three items purchased from Amazon , and a second disappointment .
Does anyone know if this an inherent problem with all the pressings ?
Perabo &apos; s acting was so annoying , she ruined the whole movie for me .
Her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded .
I just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling !
Coyote Stupid : This movie is so dumb ... &quot; HOW DUMB IS IT ?&quot;
Dumb , Dumb , DUMB . Did I mention that it stunk too .
Absolutely horrible !
What a waste of my time !
&quot;: This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type .
If you don &apos; t know yoga , it &apos; s useless .
Yoga is great for surfing , but this is a poor video .
But when the music started , he was very unhappy !!
The melody and pace are different - and the performers aren &apos; t interesting .
bad acting : This movie had bad acting .
Entertaining , but freaky : My son wanted this video so we got it .
There is a danger in making things that children think are REAL .
I found this book to be lack luster and boring .
Worst test prep book I have ever used .
: As other reviewers have suggested , this book is FULL of errors .
Which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide .
Some of the equations ( even the Henderson - Hasselbalch ) they provide are wrong .
There is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation .
Needless to say he was very disappointed as was I .
Does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one .
Not too much fun there .
I feel I wasted my money .
Very disappointing .
Which means I can &apos; t enjoy it :( I was a bit frustrated .
Talk about lousy merchandising .
Messy .
Poor example .
Misleading title : A book with a heavily religious slant .
Shame on you for writing such a book and calling yourself a counselor .
Did anyone else encounter this problem or did I just get a bad DVD .
: My fault .
It was a bad impulse buy for me .
Some parts are interesting and maybe even suspensful , but the rest is kind of dull .
Average Book : The book wasn &apos; t as great as the reviews said it was .
Some one has an EGO problem .
: I previously wrote a scathing review of this bad book .
I &apos; m not sure who it was . I still maintain that the beek is BAD .
MISSING TEXT !!!!!!
Disappointing : I got this video on loan from Netflix .
As a railfan , I was extremely disappointed in this .
The show was nothing like I had anticipated it being like .
And the host is just plain annoying trying to emulate Emeril Lagasse
Not as good as the other album !
However , I was a bit disapointed beacause it was so inferior compared to I thought about you .
In a word ...: painful .
Horrible !
I rarely HATE a movie but this bankrupt , purely perverted film is just AWFUL .
Useless : The DVD will not play .
It is horrible .
I was embarrassed for the filmmakers .
Awful Waste of Money !
It is too bad the rating system does not have a choice of zero or negative stars .
movie was a waste of money : this movie totally sucks .
i only spent 13 dollars on it and i still think i wasted my money .
the monsters were so fake and it took like an hour before anything happened .
the only cool part was at the begining when that guy died from that pole .
thats it , the movie sucked dont buy it .
The actresses were very bad at acting , and not in that cool b - horror movie way either , they suck .
over rated : had been given such a write up on this - disappointing to say the least .
No shocks - highly predictable - and with a theme that has been done to death !
harassing bears ?
Cole has been cited for harassing bear in Yellowstone National Park .
Grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states .
Vista has been in beta for a long time , so I find this delay to be inexcusable .
The instructions say that the pipe can be up to 2 - 3 / 4 &quot; long , but actually this is wrong .
Shame on you , Mr Coffee !
Worthless Piece of Crap !
: This thing needs a High Med Low setting cause the only setting it has is Low .
A Worthless piece of Crap .
Not happy with this one !
Very disappointed .
Disappointed : I am very disappointed in the Mr . coffee cup warmer .
I can &apos; t stand luke warm coffee so it is useless in my opinion .
Unfortunately , I cannot offer advice on what others because I have not found a good one yet .
Lorainne Kovar &apos; s books are GROSSLY OVERPRICED and still do not do the job they should .
I will have to drill my own holes to remedy this problem .
VERY UNHAPPY .
Too bad Galbraith isn &apos; t much of an economist .
The return policy should cover this type of problem and refund 100 % in those cases .
it came with the case broken and two discs will not play all the way through .
So now I &apos; m reluctant to buy Blu rays .
I regret getting a Blu ray player at all now .
THEY LEAK - Use SWADDLERS !!!
We bought Huggies for night time or naps . Very disappointing .
Weren &apos; t So Great .
Hated them .
I swear by Pampers ! But , even though they are less expensive , the Baby Dry type are not worth it !
Worst Ever !!
I was very frustrated .
No leaking and no washing of clothes any more !!
Not as good as Huggies Snug & Dry : When my son wheres Pampers , the poop always rides up his back .
I &apos; ve never had this problem with Swaddlers or Huggies , so I know it &apos; s not the operator .
What a waste !
They leak if you forget to change a diaper before the baby sleeps .
We are sending these back as defective and ordering more swaddlers .
when it comes to change her diaper i was really shocked .
her butt and all the diaper area was in terrible red color and she had the worst rash so far .
I was wrong .
Not as good as Cruisers : I normally buy Pampers Cruisers , I will not buy these again .
The swaddlers didn &apos; t have good protection and he would poop out of them .
They are awful every diaper he either pees or poops out of .
I am really not happy with Baby Dry .
However , when the box arrived the diapers smelled AWFUL -- chemical - like .
Pampers : These pampers were the worst , my son was soaked .
I have almost an entire case of these that I am donating because I don &apos; t trust them .
Leak with breastfeed poop up the back !
Then got to waste time and change her shirt with poop and whatever else the poop got on !
Annoying !
A Mistake : A co - worker gave this book to me .
I now regret ever having read this silly book and am planning on burning it .
Shameful : In my opinion , this dvd did not contain any worth while figure skating coverage .
My five year old was in TEARS because we could only find five second clips of actual skating .
SHAME ON YOU NBC .
The martial arts were &quot; ok &quot; in this , but nothing I havent seen done better before .
There is NO center channel on the multi channel layer .
If you are serious about multi channel recordings this is the worst ...
bad power suplly : i bought this 18 months ago .
Many people have experienced this problem with the ps
General Overview of Bizarre Cases , too obtuse for crime scholars .
POOR QUALITY : This is a very poor quality necklace .
No bill in the box , so sadly , I am unable to return .
Really BAD : The product was in a very old box and the AC / DC connection was just a bare wire .
THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AS I FEEL I &apos; VE SPENT MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS . THANKS FOR NOTHING !!!
Not pleased : I am not very pleased with this product for a couple reasons .
He suffers paralyzed in a hospital bed and dies .
There is nothing useful after that point and there is a LOT of overacting .
Defective Machine - Don &apos; t buy !
I thought maybe I had a bad machine , so I took it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one .
A month later , same problem !
Phone Cover : Not the greatest produce .
I just haven &apos; t really been pleased with it .
The VCR is noisy - very distracting .
Complete Failure : This Album Offers Absolutely Nothing Worth Wasting Time With .
Dissapointed : I am so disappointed with the Eebee DVD .
It was a waste of money for my 2 year old
However the plot was awful .
SDRE has lost their style and emotion .
The book should be called &quot; Bad writing lessons .&quot;
However if it is not as enjoyable as the Vivaldi , why would I spend money to listen to Montero ?
the company contacted to advise of this mistake .
A few minutes of horror : There &apos; s about 15 minutes of horror film .
Instead it was dreary .
The acting , even by Jun Ji Hyun , was dreary .
The actions by the characters were dreary .
I was totally cheated .
That way , no customer would ever have to be fooled again .
: Give it up everyone , Rammstein is dead .
( p103 ) This struck me as rather compassionless , especially for a book about parenting .
Horrible !
Waste of $$$$.
Sucked .
waste of paper and money !
It arrived damaged .
I was very discouraged about the idea of ordering again .
Although some apparently disagree , not a good choice for anyone over four years old .
Very disappointed : This arrived in a different package and bottle than shown .
It also has a nasty , dirty spot where some sort of sticker was removed .
That was a couple of hundred dollars wasted .
Now i get paper jam warnings when there is no paper in the bloody machine .
I had trouble installing it even though I work in IT .
Who Framed Roger Rabbit : I bought this movie new , but it will not play on my DvD player .
I am very disappointed with this product .
Idk : It doesn &apos; t play in normal DVD players .
One of the worst movies ever made !
Come on , this movie has horrible acting , a dreadfully bad story and &quot; hilariously &quot; unfunny jokes .
I had high hope for this movie , but boy what a waste of time this was .
But still , this blanket statement about the power of thought really bothered me .
I would not have ordered this had I know it was coming from England & that I might have a problem
DO NOT BUY until the problem is fixed ... you &apos; ll just have to send them back .
Figured they were old reviews and had fixed the problems .
Very disappointed in that they are still selling this defective disk .
Not the real thing : I couldn &apos; t believe my eyes when I saw the amazingly low price for this product .
Never got the faster speed but it worked fine for 2 1 / 2 years and died suddenly .
Snooz - a - pa - looza : Total waste of celluloid , not to mention time , money etc .
Not entertaining at all .
Not creative at all .
Absolutely nothing happens in this ill attempt at making something provocative .
horrible !!!
bummer and I had to pull myself through it !!
I really cant understand why we cant just leave him alone !!
Kurt &apos; s probably turning in his grave over this .
All in all take my word for it , this is a waste of money and time !
What a waste !
Leave it to this jackass who sold out to everything Kurt Cobain wasn &apos; t .
What a waste , another person selling out to the all mighty dollar trying to make his film career .
I was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be .
Difficult Read : This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far .
I have read and reread the story , but still have difficulty summarizing the story .
The excruciatingly long paragraphs are what makes it so difficult to follow .
Not true .
Shame !
Expected more ...: not as good as Celtic Woman or Hanley Westenra ...
I would say not half good .
Useless for Home theatre or TV show .
Wrong size : I have no idea how good or bad this item is .
I like this artists music , but was not too thrilled with this CD .
If you &apos; re good looking for Steinbeck , I suggest the &quot; Rapes of Wrath .&quot;
don &apos; t read this book : When I started reading the book at school I found it boring .
but the theme doesn &apos; t make it a pleasure to read .
They have a dream but it &apos; s very difficult for them to make it true because of Leenie &apos; s dumbness .
When they &apos; re working in ranch problems happens because of Leenie .
It was the worst thing ever .
I feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring !
Terrible camerawork and spotty acting over - all .
Bad editing and annoying Cali pop - punk soundtrack , only saved by the presence of Quasi .
Boy was I wrong !
Bad , Bad , stupid , poor writing , acting , filming , generally it sucked !
His voice is good enough , but his music is just so corny and boring .
He said people are tired of fake pop stars .
Personally I think he is a disgrace to the North Carolina name .
Crawling under a rock to spare my ears the agony .....: Ugh !
I just think that this cd has some crappy songs with crappy lyrics .
When a good voice meets bad music : This album is a complete waste of Clay &apos; s voice .
All I can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad Air Supply meets bad Barry Manilow .
It hurts : It hurts to see Clay fall like this .
Unfortunately on this CD Clay is overpowered by background singers .
It lacks any luster and will probably get lost in a pile of old CD &apos; s .
I think it &apos; s awful with the exception of two tracks - &quot; Measure of A Man &quot; and &quot; This is the Night &quot;.
The background music is far too loud and drowns out Clay most of the time .
Why I Hate Potato Chips : Actually I love Potato Chips ... this just plain SUCKS .
What is wrong with you people ?!
And this guy supposeldy freakin &apos; LOST !
There &apos; s something wrong here folks .
This album deserves NEGATIVE 10 STARS !
: Why would any lucid human being waste their money buying this junk ?
He &apos; s destroying those classics with his &quot; broadwayesque &quot; voice .
I am a huge fan of Clay &apos; s , but was very disappointed with this CD .
Big disappointment !!!
: Bought it and was a bit disappointed .
girls are crazy over him !!
Teen Titan Tower falls apart : This toy is absolutely terrible .
Even a four year old can see how lame this toy is .
IT &apos; S TERRIBLE !!
This book is just an encyclopedia of waste .
It is a very frustrating read because there are absolutely no examples .
Car Parts ( struts ) for [] Java []...: This book is a complete waste of time .
Really bad style .
Through the Madness !!!
Temperature displayed is incorrect : The accuracy of this thermometer is really poor .
The replacement has same problem I did calibrate it , still it shows wrong temperature .
: The new Resident Evil Outbreak is boring .
I expected it to be action - packed , boy was I wrong .
The Worst of Kirk Whalum : Kirk Whalum is a fantastic saxophonist but this one is a disaster !!
Horrible product : This shirt is absolutely the worst in the market .
A clas - sick that made me sick : This book was very boring .
A disappointing read for the 21st century : This book is a classic .
But I found it a rather boring and drudging read .
A real mess .
There were battles that never took place .
In fact , fighting was the main focus of this movie .
Anything that had any hint of spirituality was obliterated from the movie .
One of the worst mountaineering books I have ever read .
It leaves a terrible white residue that takes forever to rub in . Maybe because of the high SPF ?
I am not sure , but I was definitely disappointed .
Isn &apos; t worth my time and frustration to send it back .
A waste of money -- and tin .
Misleading : You get what you pay for with this set .
One full DVD is the lame three stooges cartoons .
But alas - Curly is not easily found in this compilation .
Also - a lot of the &quot; extra features &quot; are lame .
The rest of the set is crap .
Horribly Disappointed !
it seem to be crude and it &apos; s really a book for girls only .
BORING : I have never read a book that was so boring .
I didn &apos; t like the character of Patty , she seemed so pathetic and she whined too much .
The book disturbed me .
However , the zippers are done in very low end quality .
and the zippers are terrible always get caught . its roomy but its cheap !
Despite the packaging , however , the fundamental basis for his theory is fatally flawed .
There are EVIDENT growing ERRORS in this book .
boring & pretentious crap !
We read selected chapters of the book . They writing was horrible .
Instead , he comes off as boring and pretentious . Skip this book ... try something else .
Elton John &apos; s duet with Randy Newman just isn &apos; t as much fun .
I was just disappointed .
the songs lost the flavor i was looking for .
Disappointed in that !
Their life & times , trials & stamina through the Depression , war ( s ), and raising families .
As it is , Brokaw cannonizes his subjects and does a poor job telling the real story .
A waste of time : Mostly pontification .
Regrettably , one has to wonder about the accuracy of his reporting on NBC News .
The phones are useless , and I &apos; m stuck with them . You can guess my advice .
): The book is the reprint of a old edition date back 1948 with some little update up to 1963 .
: The introduction mix with lot of unusual verbal , loud and unpleasant voice !!!
not that good : all the songs in my opinion are very cheesey .
Boring Waste of Time !
In my estimation it was pretty much a waste of time and a total waste of money .
NOT MUCH TO SMILE ABOUT HERE !
This is a horrible , horrible movie .
The dialog was so contrived and mindless .
There was not a laugh to be had and the chemistry between Kinnear and Holly was nonexistent .
Broke in 10 months .
The cost to repair it makes it useless because I would just have to repair it again in 10 months .
We made a big mistake .
The instructions are quite poor .
: This is very odd .
It &apos; s just sad .
So now I &apos; m stuck with doubles of everything and out thrity bucks .
I was not impressed .
It is a ROYAL pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving .
Hate it : We hate this thing .
Screws made of PLASTIC !
However , after 3 days I noticed that one of the inner arms was loose .
Bad release .
I wouldn &apos; t recommend this book .... too much dam sex !
Drunk SpongeBob ??
A Disappointing movie .
Worst Movie in years !!
It &apos; s so STUPID !
&quot; the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever &quot;!!!!
Bad purchase .
Big waste of money ( and space in my house !
What a waste !
A very simplistic and selfish point of view .
It really sucks !
What a waste .
At that time i hated the book .
it was so boring i just fell asleep .
what a disappointment
First of all , the characters are the most boring people in the world .
Just don &apos; t read this book it isn &apos; t good .
Along with the lack of plot , those inconsistencies are what make this a brutal read .
Very bad work by Elizabeth Speare review for Mr . Jones : I think this book was boring .
This is why this story was boring .
The characters were annoying and obtuse , it was hard reading such a disgusting piece of lititure .
Kit was such an unintelligent and snooty creature it was infurating to read about .
The quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic .
This book was also very boring and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action .
The events were very boring and predictable .
Their anoying voices and pathetic melodies are , well , annoying and pathetic .
I will admit that the sound is much like older Oasis recordings , but that &apos; s just the problem .
Oasis may be the most popular British band , but they aren &apos; t the best .
Silver Sun , the Dandys , Shed Seven , Catatonia , Northern Uproar ), and that &apos; s a shame !
wrong book right title : We were trying to get winter of the world by Ken Follet .
However , the vocalist of Sugarcoma fails to make the music enjoyable with her weak screaming .
Sugarcoma just makes it annoying .
Being nearly twenty years old , maybe some of my problems are with it being outdated .
worst investment : Paid $ 300 . 00 for these about 5 years ago .
The overall quality of sound and durability was very disappointing .
I especially did not enjoy Part II , when I just kept wondering , what the heck is going on ???
What a disappointment .
no batmobile !!!!
It was not good .
The dialog was awful , the plot ridiculous ( we have to destroy it in order to save it ).
I think the magnets are way too weak .
Disappointing : Firstly , I found this cream to have an odd smell to it .
STRUGGLE OF WOMEN : I was disappointed in this book .
I was disappointed in the cold , compassionless character of Charlie Kate .
Her hatred of men , I think , was more of a jealousy .
Really sucks the big unit .
Unhappy .... Constantly Turns Off : Very disappointed with this amp .
VERY frustrating .
Too noisy : An annoying amount of hum and hiss comes from my speakers .
The audio on this dvd is horrible .
I wouldn &apos; t recommend this book to anyone who is not that good at math .
Third , the movie is actually boring ; a boring Robocop movie !
It won &apos; t even be a good RoboCop movie .
POOR ATTEMPT FOR A ROCK ALBUM : EVERYTHING ABOUT ALBUM MAKES ME WANNA GRAB A GUN AND SHOOT MYSELF .
THAT &apos; S HOW BAD IT IS .
IT &apos; S LACKS EMOTION , AND IT SOUNDS FORCED .
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CD IS SO GENERIC , SO DULL , SO PREDICTABLE .
ONLY A MORON WOULD THINK THIS IS A WORTH WHILE CD TO LISTEN TOO .
Needless to say , there are MANY dead before it ends .
Now logically , the inevitable illegal pregnancies would have to be halted by abortion .
Forced government abortions .
Fascist Argentina in the 1970s ? Wonder why so many copies of her book are available for sale used ?
Disappointing .
This has the most number of failures .
He and his brother are poor , his brother gets girls ( he doesn &apos; t )... boring .. boring .
: Every recipe I have tried thus far has been either 1 ) bland or 2 ) outright disgusting .
Just got it today and it sneaks in all sorts of nonsense .
i was very disappointed in it as it was noted nowhere it was christian based .
It doesn &apos; t fit well at all .
Bloody Awful : I found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring .
Gee , what a wonderful guilt trip to impose on a grieving mother ...
Big disappointment and some mistakes with Civil War history .
But he was quickly disappointed .
Was just as disappointed with another spiderman blaster .
Even those with mental illness are not so lackluster .
: R kelly &apos; s carrer is full of contradictions .
But these never seemed to get broken in .
hate it : I have been reading this book in my intro to native american studies .. and I hate it ...
I feel it give the wrong image towards northwest native history ...
This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper !
This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper !
Don &apos; t make the same mistake I did !
Poor product from dishonest dealer : Ordered two , and billed for two , as Christmas presents .
Would have given this a negative rating , if &quot; 1 &quot; were not the lowest number available .
[ bad deal ]: Listin to The velvet underground &apos; s Murder Mystery and then listen to chop suey .
: This music is sooo old and tired .
(...) Anyway , musically the CD is average , and lirically the CD is terrible .
global puzzle : poor Adam Crall , reviewer .
Neither worked well and failed soon after using .
Lamebrain to the hill .
Keanu Reeves is still his same self here , which means that he gives another boring acting turn .
Overblown Mess : This is bad .
Guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment : boring , boring and boring .
For that alone , it will burn in cinematic hell .
Weak , very weak .
Most of the performances are not very good .
Despite Rachel Weisz , the movie is bad and not even her talent could have saved it .
When the old tired plot finally starts to unravel , we didn &apos; t care what was going on .
I felt that the actors are an insignificant part of this movie , they don &apos; t matter .
What the HELL were they thinking ?
I rented this movie expecting a scary thriller and it almost put me to sleep .
I was very disappointed for this film is just plain awful !!!!!!
Dumb and pretty bad .
You get one of the worse movies ever made .
Pretty bad : Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made .
If she were not in the movie , my rating would be in negative numbers .
I can not fathom the audience for this film except for the blind , deaf and dumb .
It is hard to tell whether the fault is the script the director or the actor .
In short the film was a total waste of time .
This was the worse .
: Horrible can &apos; t describe this movie in a right light .
Rachel Weisz is great but the movie is a disaster .
I trust Continental but this was a failure .
WASTE WASTE WASTE : All I reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money .
The worst part is that even after all of that , the gum tasted terrible !
I highly doubt that the manufacturer truely tested this process with parents and children .
Frustrating and a waste of time .
boring : I was hoping to really get in to this but it was to boring for me .
Almost too bad for MST3K ...: This was one of the worst Sci Fi movies ever !
terrible product : Bought this to remove a wart .
: I thought it &apos; s a score book , just like &quot; The Corrs / The Corrs &quot;, but I am totally wrong .
Was I ever wrong .
After a while of playing Everquest Online , this became very annoying and inconvenient .
Disappointed !
I wouldn &apos; t recommend buying this for that reason alone .
All the songs are available on other cd &apos; s so it &apos; s no problem skipping over this one .
It seemed as if the book completely broke down and lost it after page 300 .
Analog reception proved even worse .
I wasn &apos; t the only person in our club who was disappointed .
It was a miserable story and pointless .
I don &apos; t know how those two got on this CD but fans of Kristofferson should be enraged .
The author failed to show me any reason to be afraid of these bodies .
I don &apos; t want a replacement ... one bad experience is enough for me .
world but seeing how that is not the case , it &apos; s really not good for anyone .
Do Not Buy : This item did not work and it just irritates your skin .
Violence Bonjour ?
: How many graphically described violently mutilated corpses do they think it takes to sell a book ?
Awful !
: This book was boring and poorly written .
: Readable and missing no pages ?
TERRIBLE !!
I tried to enter a 0 rating but I guess 1star is as low as you can go .
Boring characters , unrealistic scenarios .
Another one ...: ... of those bands whose latest work disappoints me .
Worst in the series thus far .
: By far this is the worst book in the series .
But this latest , The Ram Rebellion , just stinks .
Not so much : I was very disappointed with this ring .
Worthless : This stuff is a ripoff .
Dangerous !
It is a dangerous concoction .
It needs warning labels , and testing .
Disappointed : I developed white spots on my legs after using a tanning bed .
Unfortunately it did nothing for me .
Mark now has a price on his head for his death .
Mark and his new family will fight for his freedom or die trying .
Will Mark survive the war to go on to find the light or die defending his new life and family ?
I was stupid for not checking it out before I bought it .
Desjardin &apos; s arguments also suffer from the obvious omission of pertinent , but contrary information
Lazy reproduction of an old book .
Pure Dissappointment : I am sorry but this album was not what I was hoping it would be .
so far it has been a battle .
Im with Jim : The pedals fell off , the seats broke off .
Not a good deal at all !
Disappointed in the quality and durabiity .
What a stinker : How did this piece of junk ever get made ?
What &apos; s wrong with screen writers these days ?
Its definitaly not a classic or a good movie .
It did not do well at the box office , and everyone else I know who saw it , did not like this movie .
It wasn &apos; t as funny as any of the westerns .
Very disappointed , not with deliver or anything just the content of the video itself .
The worst book I have ever finished !!
It was tedious and dull .
I am now avoiding Moen faucets !
granted there are a couple tracks that I thought were okay , but the rest of the CD was a waste .
Check out OCZs forums for many complaints about it being quite loud .
It must be channel surfing , but there is no need for this .
I was very disappointed in Amazon &apos; s service , in sending me the wrong movie !
hate it : this would have been a good movie but the language ruined it all .
will never watch again in fact will probably destroy it .
Mother Night : Good shipping but the pages were screwed up !
Terrible !
How the hell did this happen !
A bit disappointing .
I was so angry I immediately threw it in the biggest trash can I could find .
I was so angry I didn &apos; t want to talk about it , let alone give time to write a review , until now .
My real problem with his story is that it was so repetitive .
I also think that phone number given is fake , because nobody ever answers the phone .
The material has a boring sameness to it I am not used to in an Oldies Collection .
Uninspiring Cd : The songs are third rated ones that do not inspire .
Dull : I &apos; m not sure why this book got so many five star reviews .
It &apos; s not a terrible book , but I found it to be incrediably predictable and dull .
Wolfe goes into a lot of useless rambling that has little if nothing to do with the plot .
A minute into the first song I regretted buying them .
First of all , they &apos; re ugly as all hell .
The noise cancelling consists of a distracting static frequency , and there is no bass whatsoever .
I was too distracted by the fact that it reminded me of bad early 80s music .
Primitive concepts outdated by todays understanding : I have no doubt that C . S .
It is worthless .
If I could give this book a NEGATIVE FIVE , I would .
What a disappointment !
Not too impressed with this purchase .
A disappointing book .
: The heroine is a bloody racist ( which is taken for wit , I guess ).
Too thin : I wanted to like these pants so bad .
I verbal review sections are practically useless , and the strategies do not work .
I was very disappointed and had forgotten it before it was even finished .
Not worthy of One Star .
When it comes to lame , witless and downright stupid movies , Ben Stiller is on quite a roll .
WTF ???
Do NOT buy this edition of Democracy and Education : This edition of the book is absolutely awful .
Had to buy it : I was forced to buy this for a grad class and it was absolutely boring .
Not an easy read : I didn &apos; t enjoy reading this one .
I know Hardy isn &apos; t the most cheery writer , but this was beyond just depressing -- it was boring .
The almost Dickensian sequence of hard - to - swallow tragedies was too contrived for my taste .
Decent products , unacceptable customer service -- buyer beware !
I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone .
A haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying &quot; Damn you , damn you !&quot;
A troll type creature says something like &quot; What the Hell , am I supposed to look at .&quot;
Shocking .
Shame on Rankin Bass
How wrong I was .
I am ashamed to say that I let my children see this before I did .
I am highly disappointed and so are my children because they cannot watch this movie .
Some people like it , but i think it &apos; s a bad movie and doesn &apos; t have really good characters .
Worse ( MUCH worse ), the soundtrack suffers from noticable pitch inconsistencies .
It sounds like a dub from a BAD cassette tape .
If you don &apos; t care who sings , then buy it .
I regret buying this cd , because the vocals don &apos; t appeal to me .
Unfortunately on this cd that option is not available .
Disappointing !
It &apos; s also boring .
Disappointed : I was very disappointed in this book .
Very disappointing .
Very disjointed .
Warning - misleading listing : This item is advertised as being the R - rated ( original ) version .
sound effects generation unworthy of either the Disney moniker or Mannheim Steamroller .
Then I read this sequel and had to admit that it was likely the worst book I &apos; d ever encountered .
The dubbing is bad and the plot is so unoriginal .
Sucked : I should have known that a Van Damme movie would not be worth the time or money .
It simply sucked .
Now the food cooked using these tarnished pots are tasting bit bitter ( metallic taste ).
Very poor quality product .
To say that they lack credibility would be an understatement ( Air America , etc ?).
poor quality : I purchased this from renovaters supply in March 2005 .
The chrome plating is also of poor quality .
Rule # 1 : Just because it &apos; s published doesn &apos; t mean it &apos; s true .
: This one of the worst abominations ever put in print to &quot; describe &quot; Catholicism .
It is of note only for its ludicrous claims , half - truths , and outright lies .
A sad joke that still infects some of the more naive minds out there .
Totally ignorant , very very poorly done or just plain intentional lies to mislead people .
Not good enough : I like David and have seen him live .
So I say it just wasn &apos; t good enough .
I regret buying this book .
It didn &apos; t help my vision : I followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind .
This is a waste of money .
No plot : The story plot of this movie sucked .
I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go .
Ewwwww ...: What the hell ?
Weird and beyond disturbing .
I had trouble figuring this one out .
Didn &apos; t care for this one at all .
I suppose the writer thought it would be witty but it is just a ridiculous plot .
( Cheryl is the daughter who died but Hornberger describes Cheryl as testifying at the trial .)
Simple proofreading could have corrected these mistakes .
There &apos; s no denying that the Tudor era was racy and dangerous .
good idea , poor implementation : Poor quality product .
Very disappointing purchase .
baby boy and found it difficult to nurse him with it .
it isnt worth your effort to read such a terrible book .
whoever called it a classic is crazy
Weird : I had to read this book for literiture class I hated it .
Not the Best novel : Well I have read this in 7th grade .
Very disappointed !!!
It &apos; s a good book , but not my favorite : Golding was trying to say that there is evil in everyone .
I believe everyone does something that is evil .
I think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring .
He also used too much violence , which in my opinion , only made it worse .
I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash .
If it was me who wrote the book , I would use less description becuase is made it boring .
: This book stunk .
I believe that reality can have deeper meanings , but don &apos; t get to deep or you &apos; ll drown .
Disgusted : I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel .
Boring : I would not reccomend this book .
It was very boring and I didn &apos; t find much of a purpose .
The end was the best part , but it was still bad .
Everyone should read it because it &apos; s a classic but I didn &apos; t enjoy it .
Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls .
I also didn &apos; t like how Piggy died .
Disappointing : Outdated and Not Useful : This book was written in 1987 !
But the lack of extras is irksome .
However , I had trouble finishing this book .
very dull and witless : This was a dull read that I had to force myself to finish .
Very concerned about The Einstein Syndrome : First of all , I am quite offended by this author .
I guess I will never make it to that level , because I think this is one terrible book .
All of this occured after Wolfe &apos; s death .
Poor Service from Home and Beyond : I still have not receivied what I ordered and paid for .
They claim the first shippemnt was damaged and have yet to ship a replacement .
Parker has tried to create a male Spencer but fails miserably .
If I didn &apos; t know any better I could swear that this book wasn &apos; t even edited !
Paper quality is the worst .
Not good : I tried to read it , it was just so boring and bad .
and the actors portraying Clay Shaw and David Ferrie are horrible .
NO pinyin and NO example sentences .
I am extremely disappointed .
I repeat : NO Pinyin and NO example sentences .
We can imagine much worse that what we see .
Interesting , where the hell has Dillon been since this abortion of a film ?
McQueen is also dead .
It was tedious , boring and repetitive .
Very disappointed !
: Very disappointed with this item !
Many of the holes were either drilled too small or , even worse , drilled in the WRONG PLACE .
Some pieces are cut the wrong size and just don &apos; t fit !!
What a terrible WASTE OF MONEY .
Very disappointed .
I was not pleased : I was having trouble finding a copy of this classic movie anywhere .
I am glad to have this in my collection nonetheless but was upset it was not original .
Settle in on a dark winter &apos; s night by a fire , put on some quiet music , and read the epic poem .
Bad fight scenes .
Take my advice and skip this sad attempt .
Musically and lyrically a disaster .
I think the publisher should be ashamed .
Not Good At All : This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen .
I hated it .
Even that part was bad , and I didn &apos; t see all of it !
I &apos; d give it - 10 stars for horrible scenes , cruelty to animals , and lack of trying .
poor : The product did not operate as stated on the box .
Not good at all !
This book is a total waste , though !
What a disappointment !
These movies really made me MISS the Robert Urich series !
I did not care for her writing style , nor did I find her information moving or educational .
Unless she &apos; s an idiot .
I would give this rating a negative 2 starsif I could .
This is the worst design Gillette has yet put forth .
Somehow not as good as Birks : They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks .
A huge disappointment !
Money wasted .
I think you wrong the part , I receive Part No .
Very disappointed : The NCIS movie i ordered came in in a timely manner .
I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one .
These have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality .
terrible : Continues to freeze movie and my TV .
Useless . suggest no one get this .
This one really sucks .
This reeaallly bad movie suffers from everything .
Lot &apos; s of familiar faces in this , but their acting is uninspired , and the script is dreadful .
The plot concerns a plot to get an inheritance and a bunch of greedy heirs .
WATCH A WOMAN GET RAPED , BEAT , & TERRORIZED .
Did anyone witness this woman being raped ?
People are just going on a murder &apos; s word that she was rape by these men .
You would never say it was okay for a man to murder a woman no matter what she did to him .
This is sexist and sick .
It is about the raping of a girl and she gets revenge .
Not a Great Book : I was a little surprised by the content of this book .
I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair .
Very unhappy .
A waste of money , to say the least .
I guess the stress of sitting in the cabinet for a few weeks was too much for it .
Tried it the second time to see if I just wasn &apos; t using it right , and still wasn &apos; t thrilled .
It is now in my dead heap pile of unused hair gadgets .
It is difficult to maneuver and not powerful enough to blow out my short flippy style .
But on normal paper , it flares and distorts writing .
Leading character was very immoral and there was language .
poor product : I brought this product 7mths ago and it has been falling apart .
she &apos; s so dull : She started out as the &quot; German Britney Spears &quot; and somehow she got stuck there .
A waste of money !!!
The characters lacked personality and didn &apos; t look as interesting as the others .
i must say , i was highly disappointed .
This book is full of lies .
What it preaches is blatantly wrong and you would be a fool to believe a word of it .
Unfortunately ., I was disappointed .
The movie while poignant , was spasmodic and disjointed .
By the way , I think Courtney put a hell of a show on at the tour !
Manson ... a bit sick .
Worthless : Doesn &apos; t fit the average 10 &quot; subwoofer .
It is horrible !
Never &quot;, available from Pilgrim Brethren Press , po box 171 , Petersburg , Ohio 44454 .
Too bad he didn &apos; t study some of the books he listed .
merlin : not that good .
Difficult .
Worst film ever ?
Horrible : I am only 14 years old .
It was the biggest waste of money in my life .
Yuck , Yuck , Yuck : I hated this movie .
Sure , maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating .
NOBODY acts like this ! What the hell is the point of this movie ?
To scare the crap out of parents ? Also , the rape scene was vile .
A FULL MINUTE LATER , I started feeling awkward and uncomfortable .
It wasn &apos; t even artistic , it was just disgusting and truly disturbing .
something u would &apos; nt expect : this movie is terrible .
charectors are weak and the plot just plains sucks on white bread .
Why put us through 500 pages of pain .
I am the only person I know who hates Emma .
Rubbish : What rubbish . Way too much violence .
Why do kids movies have to be so violent these days ?
We both felt this book was too basic and we did not get helpful information .
The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth .
Sam Zeman was laughing so much he lay back on the floor , but then choked and had to sit up .
Awful movie .
Acting is okay to bad , quality is okay to bad , story is okay to bad .
Hoping , But NO : Was hoping other reviews were off , but unfortunately they were right .
you get a double punch on your Hurter Card for sitting through this .
It &apos; s the worst book which has ever been written .
Ulysses : This book is a struggle .
Italics are capitalized : Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable .
Dirty and cheap : Can you make a cheaper case that these chips come in ?
Poor Quality : The quality of the case is poor .
Some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow ?
My biggest complaint about this book is that most of the chapters were boring .
Nowhere nearas funny as the Scary Movie movies .
A very , very bad movie : I recently witnessed this car crash of a movie .
One of the worst out there .
The writers had alot to work with , but they failed miserably .
Torture to watch : I went to see this but it was not by choice .
So does all the Scary Movies ( I don &apos; t like these either ).
The humor and mocking was so dis - tasteful and a little offensive .
Dated and Dull : This is waaay before the age of personal trainers .
Worst movie in history : Where to start ?
This thing is so bad that it is a disgrace to bad melodrama .
The plot is so predictable it is sickening .
I was sad to discover that Chris O &apos; Donnell can &apos; t act .
Part of the problem might go to the director .
In fact the director is highly suspect .
Difficult Viewing : This film is difficult to watch for many reasons .
Refund : This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen .
We were both very lost for about the first 25 minutes .
: I was extremely disappointed with Airplane II : The Sequel .
But since I &apos; ve seen the sequel , it hasn &apos; t been as funny .
Not Just &quot; Borderline &quot; Terrible -- It Is Terrible !
This movie is so bad I don &apos; t know where to start .
It &apos; s even worse than &quot; Body of Evidence &quot; and that &apos; s saying something .
Madonna is at her all time low , and it is a low that few stars ever reach .
Bad : The video kept timing out .
HORRIBLE , WASTE OF TIME !
: This book is one of the worst books I &apos; ve ever read .
the story was kinda weak .
But its a sequel i guess . Dont waste your time .
Was not very good and was a bit way too campy .
The film is poor .
it was as dumb as dumb can get .
What a waste of time : This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector &apos; s Edition .
Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic .
Something this film is woefully lacking .
Such shit : This movie is the worst of modern movie making : big budget , small art .
I like the photo illustration concept but the book content itself is disturbing .
As a child , I myself found it highly disturbing .
Would absolutely not recommend this product at all .
There is too much unnecessary information and the &quot; 60 minutes &quot; peoples &apos; portrayal is too harsh .
The Emperor Has No Clothes : Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS - stars .
This film is garbage ; boring , pretentious , and meaningless .
Perhaps other reviews can attach their own fantasies and for them this DOA film may say something .
But I found it an irritating waste of time .
Even if it is technically ( grammatically ) correct , it is extremely difficult to read .
Very boring .
Stilted broken part - way descriptive sentences .
I really didn &apos; t care if they ended up together .
This was definitely a dud , no offense intended to the author of course .
I am very disappointed in it . We will be purchasing an electric bug zapper soon to replace these .
I &apos; m greatly disappointed
A thourough disappointment .
I &apos; t get &apos; s really old after awhile listening to her complain !
Compared to the first two episodes , &quot; Los Angeles &quot; is lamentably lame .
Pathetic movie feels like a made for TV movie !
I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers / viewers .
SO overrated : This is a top contender for the worst book ever written .
This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it .
not the worse film or acting ...: but definately not the best or even above average .
A Train Wreck : This film really misses its mark .
0 Star Presentation of a 5 Star Movie ; Sony / Image Lied : This is apropos of the DVD version .
All I can really say is that I was truly disappointed and I don &apos; t know who was at fault .
: Has James Patterson sunk so low that he &apos; s now penning drivel just for the money ?
I am angry that his publisher was so greedy to do it !
His lame dialogue is beyond tedious .
-- he has a brain tumor and is likely to die .
Majorly sucked : This book was jam - packed with cliches and wooden characters and dialogue .
Some of the worst writing I have ever read !
I don &apos; t know which group is singing but it &apos; s the wrong one .
Disappointing .
Complete waste of time : I think this is the worst remake of any movie of all time .
really BAD Sony transfer .
Granted the film is supposed to take place at night , the new transfer is quite frankly awful .
From terrible dialogue to terrible themes , this movie is just TERRIBLE ...
no extra features !
First of all there are no making of , storyboard , production notes or any extra features !
Pinocchio not the only one who lies !
No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version !
This movie was such a bad movie !
But that &apos; s not what I &apos; m here to talk about , I &apos; m here to talk about how bad this movie is .
Not very good : I actually ordered two dirtbags and within a week , they were both leaking dirt .
I wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it , instead of stories of angry , sad boys .
Quite possible the worst movie of all times .
Extremely torturous to watch .
Disappointing .
A disappointment !
I was appalled .
What business refuses to replace damaged items ?
Very disappointed : This is a set book for the University course I &apos; m following .
Not her best : I love Virginia Henley but these characters are so disconnected and unromantic .
I watched this scene from my window with horror and I still am not sure what to do about this .
A heavily armed S . W . A . T team tossed in a few tear gas canisters and broke down my front door .
Can of cancer : I got some of this stuff to cover myself with during Halloween .
: It did little more than power a death star , so I returned it to the Earth forces ... DO NOT BUY !
WARNING : DO NOT EAT : Oratory ingestion is not recommended .
This is distressing , at first .
Most of the second act is dull .
Rent only if you want to annoy your boyfriend .
Boring , silly and a waste of time . What do men want ?
This is distressing , at first .
Most of the second act is dull .
Rent only if you want to annoy your boyfriend .
Besides if you get rid of D & D who will you blame when they finally do kill someone ?
What is far worse , though , is that the editing in this book is horrendous .
There are spelling errors throughout the text .
There are many grammatical errors in this edition .
? Just did not enjoy them really .
TERRIBLE , TERRIBLE .
And a point that should go out , THERE IS NO CAR CHASE !
I will end by saying that this trashy film deserved no oscars !
: I never thought that Maryl Streep could give a bad performance .
I could have gone without buying this foolishness
Worthless !
I did everything I could to insure they would adhere well , but to no avail .
I really don &apos; t recommend this product .
: Purchased this a while back , and was disappointed from the moment I opened the box .
All this thing did was waste time and money .
drying and sticky : I didn &apos; t care for this product at all .
The characters are cold and it is difficult to empathise with them .
continuous suspense , convolutions , but no resolution .
: I rather liked &quot; Dune &quot; but this poor excuse for a sequel is just plain awful !
Time and again I found some passages awkwardly worded .
Whoever made the kindle version should be fired .
Horribly Disappointing : First , I will be upfront : I didn &apos; t get very far in this movie .
I was very disappointed with this movie .
It criticizes everything about Jane Austen &apos; s time period .
As strange as it sounds , I felt like I was being attacked through the movie screen .
It is a movie full of lies .
Unfortunately , the book is nothing more than a lead in to the show .
Very frustrating .
This is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series .
Terrible fast forward and backwards , goes to slow .
Worst CD player I have ever owned .
Not a hero .
Some of them were even being held prisoners by the enemy at the time .
Campaign for Kerry : To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry &apos; s life is extremely naive .
Waste of time and money : This book is a waste of valuable paper .
I hated the book and have no respect for the man behind it .
For example , we usually prohibit ad hominem attacks .
Shame !
Shame !
Dangerous !
The information is misleading (&quot; GPSr : Slang of a GPS receiver .&quot;
Pathetic Attempt at Bond : This film is awful .
<*** This movie is BAD !
6 . You &apos; re a student from the USC film class &quot; Bad Movies 101 &quot;.
You had nothing better to do with your time and money .
Mindless , Pointless and Insulting : Bad .
Just plain awful .
A total waste of time for the thinking movie goer .
It saddens me that movies have come to this .
The acting : bad , the stunts : bad , the plot : VERY bad .
I wouldn &apos; t wish seeing this movie on my worst enemies ( even thogh I have none ).
Triple Bad !!!
Vin Diesel is the worst actor .
For ANYBODY to call him the &quot; new James Bond &quot; is sad and laughable .
The stunts in this movie are awesome , but the acting and plot is HORRIBLE !!
I felt ashamed that I watched this movie because it insulted my intelligence .
This movie was SO bad and to think it was a block buster hit !!!
I saw him in the Fast and the Furious , Pitch Black , Boiler Room , and so on .
I was SADLY DISSAPOINTED by this movie .
Between the mediocre acting and the tired fighting scenes .
It leaves u drained .
deplorable : this was the worst example of american literature ever published .
this book is a waste of your time , don &apos; t read it !
Pointless : This book was profane and pointless , as is w / most books I &apos; m forced to read for English .
I never knew being in AP ment I had to put up with my beliefs being violated .
What a disgrace for the Stones to put out this Lousy album .
Oh , Pleeeze : The lyrics on Biggerbang are so bad !
The costumes in the Pharoah &apos; s scene are offensive and in poor taste .
The first few bags were super but bag five , which was still in code , tasted nasty , as did bag six .
DUMB DUMB AND DUMB : this is by far the worse horror movie ever .
PLEAZE do not DO NOT buy this movie and if u do yer screwed
The video was made in 1939 , when color had just come out , and the quality of the color is awful .
Despite great acting by De Niro , this movie sucks .
I seriously felt dumber after watching this movie ; there was absolutely no plot .
No plot , no culmination , no action , no transition , no STORY .
: Talk about beating a dead horse .
Wasn &apos; t very impressed , especially after all the hype .
Boy , was I wrong .
This is indeed horrendous fake swing that doesn &apos; t hold a candle to the original masters .
Building the Custom Home Office : This has to be the worst book I have ever seen on the subject .
Useless book .
Unfortunately , the DVD is the worst analog to digital transfer I &apos; ve ever seen .
They should fire the guy who made this DVD version .
I rarely ever rate anything on Amazon , but this is so bad I felt like I had to warn other people .
and as an extra side - note , the music feels ridiculous .
I wish I had read the reviews online prior to purchasing , now I am stuck with a poor quality DVD .
TERRIBLE DVD Sound - Avoid the DVD !!
A truly horrendous offense for an animated movie , which depends so much on sound .
Disappointed ...: What a bummer .
The worst part is the poor quality of the DVD .
The quality of the movie is awful too .
Terrible DVD Transfer : My experience has been in line with several others here .
I like the film , but the quality of this transfer is just unacceptable - do not buy .
I have no idea how they messed that up !
Caution before downloading : The Kindle Touch version has been problematic for me .
Discouraged .
On my list , these are the characteristics of a bad movie .
It is dull and pretentious !
you gotta know when to fold em Kenny : Ugh !
Sad how they are being paid for this garbage .
Scott Hicks commentary is one of the most boring on any DVD .
Now we are stuck with $ 120 . 00 worth of rearm kits that are of no use to us .
The Messenger portrays Joan as a mental case who was unsure of herself and full of doubts .
&quot; Also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely gratuitous and unnecessary .
this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible .
they made joan so annoying i didnt want to watch it no more .
the action was not good at all .
The acting is so bad some of the fighting sequences are laughable .
I don &apos; t know what kind of recording equipment was used , but the sound is terrible !
STUART LITTLE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON &apos; T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE RAT ON CHARLOTTE &apos; S WEB !
Not very good : I &apos; m not a huge fan of Medieval literature , and perhaps this book is to blame .
Also the book , which is humorless , reminds me of other better - done accounts of the same areas .
But was I wrong !
Bad Book !!!
I thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards .
The fitted sheet have started piling , which indicates not a good quality set of sheets .
Overall , a disappointing read .
I didn &apos; t really like the book it was boring , the end = best .
: It was grat at some parts and boring at others .
What a disappointment .
He went crazy when he saw the commercial for this new DVD .
And we , too , were bitterly disappointed by its contents .
Need something to light a fire ?
Here you go ...: I gave this one star , because negative stars are not allowed .
The script leaves you not caring for the characters .
Terrible customer service .
Genuine Chinese Crap : This radio is insanely over - priced .
Want poor reception ?
LOUSY PHONE : Good Price with a nice package , but very poor quality sound .
poor quality : Item is very heavy and does not hold a charge well .
illumination begns to dim almost immediately and is never very bright .
Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever .
I &apos; m very disappointed with this purchase .
This movie is very poor and I believe it only stayed in theaters for about a week before tanking .
Not Recommended : I am very disappointed with this phone .
Not happening here . What dialogue and acting there is seems forced and badly delivered .
At times it was just stupid !
Doubt I &apos; ll be re - watching this movie any time soon !
Even then , I worry that the package will open in transit . Lesson learned .
sent wrong speaker : Speaker they sent was a cheap imatation .
Lousy 802 . 11 reception & transmission .
That &apos; s the sound of millions of Anne of Green Gables fans screaming in collective disgust .
Not only is this last Anne movie bad .
It &apos; s HORRIFYINGLY bad !
I was extremely disappointed that the movie thoroughly strayed from L . M .
The plot of this movie held no interest for me , and was extremely disappointing .
Not only was it a far cry from the book version , I found it to be incredibly insulting .
Not the same as Anne 1 & 2 .: This was a major disappointment .
Its far to artsy and revolves around the war rather than the characters and green gables .
I was so disappointed .
It left me feeling sick to my stomach at such a gross departure from the books and story line .
Not worth it at all and very disappointing !
It &apos; s quite horrible in every way .
I wish I could give it negative stars !
Big Problems with Amazon &apos; s Quality Control : The DVD did not match the title of the cover .
Literally the wrong movie was in the &quot; Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story &quot; sleeve .
I was very disappointed .
Not as Good : I didn &apos; t like the Continuing Story as much as Green Gables and Avonlea .
Didn &apos; t really like the war atmosphere , felt so sad .
&quot;&quot; JOHNEY DEVIL .
JOHNEY DON &apos; T CARE ABOUT NOTHIN &apos;.
JOHNEY SAYS THE ONLY GOOD COP IS A DEAD COP .&quot;&quot; Cool .
Two major problems with this router : 1 .
Wireless range is BAD ( I own a cheap router and it has twice the range ) 2 .
I managed to fix the problem for a few weeks but it RETURNED !!
Its a pain !
Lousy support after the sale : We lost the handset .
Overall disappointed with Panasonic and this phone .
Unfortunately lighting hit and blew out all my phone lines and phones .
The options they gave me were completely unacceptable .
It is a fake product .
Terrible product I want my money back .
They look comfy but the front strap is stiff and just cuts right into your toes .
There is no such thing as out smarting wall street !!
The guy called and told me it needs a new firing mechanism and it would cost $ 189 .
This was very frustrating beacaues I have to return it .
Very disappointed .
I had been trying to take them for my digestive problems , but these were actually making me worse !
Very defective bottle .
Terrible product : This is a terrible product .
Broken Drivers for Windows XP : I &apos; ve had a horrible time with this F5D6020 PCMCIA card .
Absolutely no thought has gone into design .
Tom Selleck is awful .
Mercedes McCambridge is awful ( really awful ), and sadly , worst of all is Glenn Ford .
The examples are sappy and saccharine . Cutesy kids , flowers , bla bla bla !
Its a waste of money .
Portable red flashlight : Terrible product .
He makes incredible errors of historical fact - well known historical fact , at that .
I ignored the whole rating thing which is absurd .
Worthless : As a beginner I found this book worthless .
In my opinion this book fails on all counts .
This did not work for Dream Street , unfortunately .
I am very disappointed since i got the wrong item .
I wasted my money since I can &apos; t even read it !
Simultaneously pretentious and moronic : This is even more brain - dead than the average rap CD .
); and finally , the bitter lyrics really give me a headache .
I would give it no stars if it was available !!
horrible : Bought it one and half year ago from Circuit city .
What a Shame : There is a lot of background music in this film that never made this collection .
Bummer .
Why did I waste my $$$$$?
Boy was I wrong .
The binder part wasn &apos; t very good either .
It is that bad .
Ouch : This movie hurts me to watch it .
Steven Segal gets shot up , put in a coma , and then he goes off killing people for revenge .
The action is really cheesy , the plot is awful , and the one liners make you want to shoot Segal .
This line was a mess up , the correct line is : &quot; I missed .
I must be lamer than I thought .
Such a shame .
All I know is this : I &apos; m sick and tired of reading about these dumb juries !
It starts off very strong , but half way through and all the way to the end , it is awful .
Reading this book was a chore not a pleasure .
It was such a boring book that it &apos; s a wonder that I even finished it .
After the murder trial , which takes place very quickly , the book begins to sag .
What a disappointment .
The Last Juror is tired , boring , derivative and a waste of time .
What a disappointment !
The worst Grisham book out there !!!
: I have read most , if not all , of Grishams books and this one was by far the worst !!
It is very boring , has no suspense , and jumps around a lot .
What a terrible book .
Grisham has lost his touch ....: Drivel and more Drivel .... Grisham has lost his touch .
Throw in pointless and gratuitous nude scenes , a pair of boots with six - inch heels and a weak plot .
Even the obvious physical talents of Bai Ling don &apos; t save this film , despite her best efforts .
Painfully dull , poorly written rip - off * SPOILERS *: Fearless meets the Sixth Sense .
This movie is bad .
Too bad .
bad : previous review was never printed .
Too bad .
: Expensive as it is , I thought I &apos; d have something that would give me no trouble .
This one is not a great remake of the book .
Would not highly recommend .
The casting was almost completely off the mark - Danus is particularly badly cast .
This was so bad it took me 3 trys to get through to the end .
It was delivered promptly , but the book print quality seems to be bad .
I was quite angry that I &apos; d spent $ 1 . 08 at my discount video to even rent it .
BORING !!
Home Fired !
This film was a bomb from the word go .
( I had the same problem with the new version of Upstairs - Downstairs , also by Acorn Media .)
NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS : This is NOT a compilation of Original Releases .
I &apos; m unhappy !!!!
I was extremely disappointed .
I really didn &apos; t care what happened to him or any of the characters in the book .
A big disappointment : I disagree with the reviewer who characterized the author as a poor writer .
The problem is the content .
On all those measures , Ms . Powell suffers . My recommendation : see the movie , but forget the book .
Never in my entire life have I found the narrator of a book more irritating than I did Powell .
Terrible : I found this book to be simply unreadable .
Very , very disappointing .
Stay as a Blogger : This is a terrible book .
Julie Powell is , on her own admission , not a good cook and the text proves it .
And on the evidence of this book she is not a good writer either .
I doubt it .
Poor Julia - passe she may be , but she must be turning in her grave at this travesty .
The level of profanity was so distracting that I couldn &apos; t focus on what the author was saying .
I guess I &apos; ll have hang out with the haters .
Julie Powell comes off as an extremely unpleasant , immature little princess .
The whole thing is snark and whine and it tiresome after a few chapters .
Don &apos; t waste your time or money on this awful book !
She tried to be funny - and failed miserably .
Unfortunately , I didn &apos; t enjoy much about it .
In fact , she was so distracted that most of the time she could not get out of her own way .
Horrible Recipes Made Bearable : As I &apos; m more than halfway through this book I might as well finish .
I hate it , hate it , hate it and have from the first few pages .
The author should be ashamed using her singular greatness to make money with this crass garbage .
Boy , was that a bad decision .
I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier !
Definitely the worst baby product I &apos; ve purchased .
They have 2 sizes but no chart to figure out which size you need .
Other reviews have said the small was too small , so I &apos; m not sure .
Too bad it never arrived and I had to scramble at last minute to find a copy .
So either these are NOT really from PowerStop , or I was lied to .
Then every time you try to open the wizard it flashes on the screen for a second and disappears .
Doesn &apos; t work and merchant won &apos; t allow returns : This product is horrible .
: I just spent hours of frustration trying to get this thing to work reliably .
No Mre sequals !
In fact , I do not see why this movie got a PG - 13 rating for violence .
Tobey was good as Spiderman but his character seemed a bit whiny and was too much of an idiot .
It &apos; s in my opinion if I didn &apos; t like it don &apos; t get mad why I didn &apos; t like it I just didn &apos; t like it .
: I can understand just wanting to watch a trashy action film but this movie was just annoying .
Seriously , this was a casting disaster that the marketing department saved .
That said , the rest sucks .
Money wasted .
Don &apos; t listen to the other reviewers it sucked !
: I did not like Spiderman 2 at all (...)!
I hate Tobey Maguire and all of his movies they suck and he &apos; s also boring who never says a word .
But anyways don &apos; t waste your money on this movie it &apos; s very bad .
Both Spiderman movies suck !
Awful - Nearly Painful : I liked the first movie .
the acting was horrible and the action scenes ... well there were hardly any action scenes .
This movie sucked there was way too much talking .
Doc Oc was horrible he wasn &apos; t even mean .
The backstabbing piratical villain .
The fat , ugly , cowardly , corrupt , rich villain .
The cruel villain who is , however , a &quot; true warrior &quot;.
I was VERY disappointed to find out neither were included .
But this cd is Enyas worst .
boring , boring , boring : Some have called this book a &quot; basic guide &quot; for the Enron mess .
Terrible shame .
It seems like the motor is bad or just too weak .
Asimov is probably rolling around in his grave right now .
Oh , how stupid can they be ?
They stole the title and we shall punish them by forgetting this miserable mutt .
I ordered it a second time thinking that I had received a defective disc the first time .
I was wrong .
What a travesty that this book was published !
: Drag , drag , drag .
This story had no climax , no capture , no passion .
Who wants to read about the somber day to day lives of boring spinsters ?
Or , maybe you have to be on some kind of illegal drug to make any sense of this movie ?
I tryed biting it to see if it was candy , but to no avail it was actually the dvd .
THe movie actually scared me , and i had to go to the store to buy beer , and asprin .
That Boy Mike Jones Is A Fake Man : That boy mike jones is about to get what is coming to him .
Sadly not the case , it was a lackluster title .
After a year and a half , this battery is dead .
IT IS POORLY EDITED AND FULL OF TYPOS AND ERRORS .
Good movie , terrible DVD : I have no problems with the movie .
But technically , the quality of this disc is beyond terrible .
This book shows one side , from an emotional person who was hurt and angry .
no accolades here : I threw this book in the trash , I was so very disappointed .
Poor : A very poor book .
It &apos; s mostly just a bunch of ramblings , often contradictory .
The description of the book is highly misleading , and I regret having bought it .
Sad to say the music won &apos; t .
Greek : This was not a very good movie , nor well acted .
I doubt they would last long .
WRONG !
My toes are smushed all the way to the end and they hurt !
Bad product .
All the signs point to a hardware problem .
Waste of Time .
It took almost 10 minutes and several bloody fingers to access the contents .
The case is solid but has no on & off switch .
But it does have all my files and programs . Sadly it was a waste of money .
Basically , the girls talk dirty ( sorta ) and then take off their clothes .
Just plane bad cap .
Terrible quality , very flimsy brim .
Awful item .

This song isn &apos; t disaster , but it is one of his weakest and it isn &apos; t even Elton &apos; s composition .

I found it disturbing .
I suppose Arbus &apos; real life story wasn &apos; t interesting enough .
In - fur - iating : This movie is really quite unfortunate .
Another &quot; Poor little Women &quot; novel ....: Gina and Lawrence are the main characters of the book .
Gina goes through every &quot; poor me &quot; emotion from the divorce and it gets obnoxiously annoying !
Endless , dragging , repetitive , no action .
The writers sadly appear to have let the series down .
What &apos; s Her Problem ?
: I read this book and it &apos; s obvious that Eartha Kitt has a problem with being black .
and the negative terminal connector flew apart each time .
Very frustrating in that attaching to anything of any size causes it to self - destruct .
Poor product : I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box .
It was repetitive , rambling and boring .

Warning will not play : WARNING .... be careful of buying this unless you have a HD DVD .

It was truely horrid .
horrible : One of the worst books I have ever read .
If it were not in fact his parent &apos; s publishing company I doubt he would have been published .
It &apos; s quite sad that there is nothing new in this book .

: This was one of the worst books I have ever read .
The plot was quite interesting , but the way it was wrtitten was horrible .

boring and , well , boring .
Don &apos; t let the rave reviews fool you !
The prose is unimaginative , very wordy , and fails miserably on all levels .
You Can Run But You Can &apos; t Hide : This book is a rip off the famous Star Wars Saga .
It may have been an enjoyable read but still pathetic .
I disliked it because it was contrived , poorly written , and lacking any redeeming quality .
Parents before letting your kids read this think twice about the poor example being set .
I think Paolini counted on the fact that most people haven &apos; t read Edding &apos; s masterpiece .
If you must see this travesty , complete the experience with stale popcorn .
What a dirty trick : Ran into Bestbuy today grabbed the first DVD of Potter I saw .
What a dirty rotten trick pulled by Warner Brothers .
Betrayed : If you are a fan of the book do not watch this movie .
This movie targets the mindless .
where did the house elves go , when is fudge gonna call dumbledore mad ?
i quote : &apos; harry potter and the goblet of fire is about HARRY POTTER , and THE GOBLET OF FIRE .
So , the book fails on two fronts .
Enough Chumps Will Buy It Anyway : Goblet of Fire , the movie , is an unacceptable hash .
It would be a complete waste of money even if the book did not exist .
This is not a film but an insult .
its not tht great honestly .
What a HORRIBLE book .
I am a pre - teenager and I still cannot focus on it because of its pure stupidity .

: i thought this book was the dumbest book i have read in a long time .
i hated it .
So dull .
I &apos; m not sure if it &apos; s the style of the narration or what it is , but I found it a struggle to read .
However , on Amazon &apos; s very own Kindle Fire HD that feature is not available .
The epitemy of Fantasy : This &quot; book &quot; is a travesty to everything ever written .
Swoar , lil &apos; fools wack for REALL .
A waste
This book scared me .
I found it sexist and almost racist .
Selfish and lazy .
I see a lot of readers loved it , but I thought it was a waste of time .
What a disappointment .
Sad to say , they &apos; re not .
There was absolutely no new plots involved .
What a shame .
Do we have to have her show how to make fire over and over and over ?
Tedious : Boring and tedious !
Hard - to - remember names , and an error - ridden Kindle transcription add to this reader &apos; s frustration .
Same old , same old ... but worse : Read the first couple of pages and then skip the next 250 .

No stars , No story : Unfortunately Amazon doesn &apos; t let you rate a book with zero stars .
I find Auel &apos; s latest book very boring simply because there is nothing new in the book .
BORING stuff .

Kind of makes you wonder why he almost left her behind out of fear of his people &apos; s reaction .
: I eagerly awaited the coming of this book but after reading it I am sorry I wasted my time .
What little bit of action that did happen was so weak that is wasn &apos; t even action !
No real finality to the problems that were introduced in the last book .
And with the new problems introduced in this book , the reader is left with a sense of loss .
No closure to Ayla &apos; s pain about Durc .
I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to .
boring boring boring !
This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together .
This film was not at all faithful to the book .
The amount of errors really baffled me and stressed me out .
Trying to look up things and the entire layout is just awful .
Perhaps someone lost a bet or Schiller owns their soul .
A bad chess player that writes awful books is a scary thing .
Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death is another fine example of his dry wit .
iNCREDIBLY STUPID FILM : This film really made me angry and pissed off I bothered watching it .
The 6 Messiahs is an endless stream of predictable moments and horrible plot development .
It gives very basic info that doesn &apos; t help you at all .
WASTE OF MONEY
No es que no me haya gustado , si me gusto , pero el final es algo tragico e inesperado .
defect merchandise : i purchased a sony clie pegt615 on 08 - 15 - 02 at compusa / madisonWi .

I thought the book was rather boring and was hard for me to get into .
I was expecting the main character to metamorphse into a serial killer but it doesn &apos; t happen .
Problem With These Discs : Is anyone else having issues with these discs ?
I &apos; m exchanging my discs immediately , but I have a feeling they might all be bad .
They supposedly didn &apos; t know who did it so how do they explain having the murder weapon ?
It &apos; s a shame , because the book had so much potential .
Too bad she wasted it on such triviality and shallowness .
Worst movie ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!
It is is tasteless , boring , and STUPID !
He plays a doctor investigating a patient &apos; s murder , and why the murderer lit himself on fire .

soda -- fills you up , but no nutrition .

The movie fails because it was bad told , and not well directed .

: This book was so awful I couldn &apos; t make it past page 60 .
The plot was boring .
Sad to say I didn &apos; t like this book ...

Speed - searching didn &apos; t even help .
Terrible Movie : I watched it and thought of it as just bad .
: I don &apos; t know what you people see in this movie , but it just made me ill !
With terrible production design with naked woman / dining tables and that psychadelic apartment .
Though some may argue that that is not important to the story , I dissagree .
Kubrick is no genius ... he &apos; s sick !
There are some stories to which movies just can &apos; t do justice .
Total waste of money !
My GF hates this stuff too so it was a total loss !
SOFT AND PREDICTABLE : The attempt to make another Destroyer fell very short .
: Disappointing .
This album is bad in so many ways .
That &apos; s no bad .
The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can &apos; t get down , Just a little bored .
There &apos; s no feeling , no emotion , no heart , no music .
I still regret it .
Basically , I say this album was a waste of money .
The Number is Zero : What a waste of paper and time !
Killer of SSX !!!!!!!
This one was very disappointing .
The music was horrible .
I hated the gameplay . This is baisically the game .

Joe - Oh No !
His version of Steely Dan &apos; s &quot; King Of The World &quot; sounds strained .
The other two shorts are not Burroughs related and are horrid .
however , the characters didn &apos; t do anything about their problems .
the book just makes you want to commit suicide or something .
well , at least i get $ 10 for getting an A in my stupid english class .
It moves slowly , and I catch myself losing focus while reading .
I feel like I &apos; m back in HS torturing myself to read a book .
Disappointed : I was also disappointed with this book .
Overall , a big disappointment
Who wasn &apos; t made like other folks , and for many artists that &apos; s a necessary evil .
They &apos; ve lost it : Pearl Jam died , and this was the nail in the coffin .
Gone are the furious beats of Vs , the melodic enchant of Ten , and the pure grunge soul of Vitalogy .
All I hear is a weak , tired band that has run out of fuel .
when i first listened to it i was suprised how boring it was .
The band that just won &apos; t go away : This has to be the most boring album of all time .
Right up there with Yield , Riot Act and No Code .
Warning : this album is horrible .
Is the album bad ?
I wouldn &apos; t buy this album , not even for its contagious opening &quot; Hermes &quot;.
You lost out on my money because I am not going to give my father a virus .

Not funny .
Poor satire .
Not well written : I was greatly disappointed with Bear V . Shark .
I was really , really disappointed .
Works for 6 weeks : This unit broke , simply stopped working after six weeks since opening the box .
Do not buy : I had this gun about 6 months before it just quit working .
It died in late July 2012 .
Then last Saturday the gun just died .
the book , to put in simple , non - Clancian terms , SUCKS !
Clearly it &apos; s not the dumbest book I &apos; ve ever read , but it is the worst .
Too boring , too long , too technical , too empty .
crap : This was pretty crap none of the kids like them and they are not amazing at all .
My kids threw them in the trash first day , just a waste of money
Broke down in 3 weeks : Product just quit working 3 weeks after I got it .
The graphics are awful .
I feel I was ripped off paying $ 50 . 00 for this farce .
Bad Remake : This song when sung by Berlin was wondeful and not vocally overdone .
Dropped it and it broke : I bought the 810 model , which is similar .
: The first time I tried this , it damaged the camera &apos; s lens cover mechanism .
Disappointed : I &apos; m a big Louis Prima fan but I was very disappointed with this cd .
It didn &apos; t capture the excitement of a Louis Prima show .
Animated Dean Martin Doll : I really find it difficult to rate this item for the following reason .
Unfortunately it did not perform as expected .
This book is awful !
This book is very boring and useless .
A student can not read this book , it is too boring and useless .
Waste of Money .
This is a waste of [$].
Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all , it &apos; s not just a weak taste , there is NO TASTE !
Seriously , who would do such a stupid thing .
Disgraceful : This DVD is a disgrace .
Pathetic .
How can they be so stupid ?
It sucks !
Misleading information on DVD case .
WRONG !!!
To make matters worse the DVD cover says &quot; Running Time : Approx .
I struggled to pick it up ...: Never have I been so bored by a novel set in Ireland .
I struggled to pick this book up each night ( rather than put it down ).
: I am so sick of these things being released without CDMA / EVDO or some cell service .
Does not power up after initial charge : This item arrived DOA after initial Charge .
I thought upgrading the OS system would fix the power problem .
Maybe just a bad batch , I think I &apos; ll order the N810 instead and cross my fingers .
Thie movie sets up with a father - daughter conflict that you &apos; ve seen in hundreds of other movies .
Then comes the part when the girl argues a lot with the father .
Terrible Service : I am completely annoyed with this company .
I ordered a movie and they sent the wrong one .
not delivered : thanks for nothing .

I could usually make them out , but it IS irritating .
The vocal posturing annoys and distracts .
The batteries are really really bad .
And unfortunately they did not build in an adapter to use the included AC plug .
Bad engineering . Buy a corded gun if you are serious and never worry about batteries again .
Well , he almost completely fails in that and , the worst , confuses the reader .
Bad writing .
Bad , bad writing .
: Does anyone say &quot; Crazy getup &quot;?
Also , finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy .
Just didn &apos; t care for it .
African Architecture : Hugely disappointing .
More than just a little bit disappointing for those of us who are still looking .
Crap , just crap : Book is highly boring as restates the same thing over and over .
And this is of all the crap that is american history .
Because they are just so boring .
Plus just because your american and the story is american doesn &apos; t make it great you mother *******.
Hope the book rots in hell .
It was mostly a dry historical perspective of the author &apos; s family which wasn &apos; t that interesting .
The author must be an extremely annoying snob .
Historians have been getting a lot of negative publicity lately for less that exemplary scholarhip .
I disagree .
Not For Me ...: So I don &apos; t really understand why this is considered a horror novel ?
If you want something that is scary then this is not for you .
: When I put this on my car visor , it was visually distracting and made me feel claustrophobic !
Having 30 CDs hanging over my head is just not a good idea .
Most of the people that buy it will likely only be buying it because they are forced to .
hard to follow : I don &apos; t care for the author &apos; s abuse of the time line .
Duras &apos; character development is firm , but her flashbacks are ill timed and confusing .
Unfortunately , it ended with a skittering thud and had me muttering &quot; What the huh ?&quot;
Trying to mix the two was a BIG mistake .
This movie was way too long , way too slow , too self - involved and overall just dull .
Not true .
Just because of the annoyance factor I am not .
They gave me long term pain in my teeth ( about a years worth ).
These do NOT work ... I promise !
I &apos; ve tried them and the commercials are deceiving .
The peroxide isn &apos; t strong enough .
I don &apos; t know how safe that could be , but it &apos; s not very promising to me .
THE WRITING IS VERY STILTED AND ITS JUST NOT A COMFORTABLE READ .
Worst -- Macbeth -- Ever !
Can &apos; t imagine Mr . Brett &apos; s excuse for as abysmally poor acting .
Hack writing at its laziest .
Tiesto your mix and track selection is bad !!!
And am depressed with the current state of trance music .
repetitive repetitive repetitive repetitive : how many times can you say the same thing ?
? just ask Gordon before you waste your money on this .
I had made a bad bet .
I &apos; m not thrilled with the performance .
I am skeptical and will not do it again .
I &apos; ve seen numerous errors in spelling .
Bad Edition : I would not buy this edition .
The printing is terribly small .
Beware : NO 5th BOOK !

I found Persuasion difficult to get into and did not enjoy it .
The tape , I &apos; m afraid , is very bad indeed .
: Maybe we just got a bad one , but it doesn &apos; t work .
Would it have killed the studio ?
What a disappointment .
Then all the problems arose .
I thought that would be the end of it , however , THE REPLACEMENT MACHINE IS BROKEN NOW TOO !
Sad , without coffee !!
This brewer is a piece of crap .... look at the Hamilton Beach instead .... SignedKeurig Sucks !
But now it is failing .
Don &apos; t know if I want to buy another one if it is going to go bad like the last one .
NOT worth it - tons of problems : I am so upset about my coffee maker .
Platinum series is terrible : Bought a platinum series brewer .
Multiple problems ; makes a full cup intermittently .
Then the problem started ... K - cup prices skyrocketed ...
I &apos; m a sucker .
It was broken when I received it .
: I must say that I absolutely hated this story .
This book was so confusing I don &apos; t even know what the story is really about .
: More American Graffiti is kind of sad to me .
It &apos; s sad that Terry the toad &apos; s girlfriend forgets him and becomes a hippie .
The ending is the most sad because you know John Milner is about to die because of a drunk driver .
I probably wouldn &apos; t recommend MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI !!
Horrible reception : I had this hooked up with digital cable .
It is an emergency .
It is the problem .
I have never been able to charge it because of a defective charger .
They want me to pay full postage to send back the defective charger .
Ten Days That Shook the World : I read a lot of history books and I just found this very boring .
SK &apos; s worst ever , really 0 stars : I hated it .
Bad plot , poorly delivered , terrible book .
SK has written some really good books , but this one was so bad I have not read another SK since .
Not His Best : Like many others I am a big fan of Stephen King .
. This book is really , really bad .
I am a big King fan , but I cannot in good conscience reccommend this book .
He &apos; s lost his touch .
I so wanted to like this book , but it &apos; s bad , really bad .
I was disappointed in this one , however .
The squeeze portion broke immediately and I was never able to use it .
I am very disappointed .
I assume the product was old , but under any circumstances it was defective .
The recommended dose threw me into a detox that was utterly miserable and lasted for weeks .
It took me a while to put two and two together as I just thought I was sick .
Poor taping quality , poor instructions , poor everything !
Unfortunately I received the same book .
Terrible movie .
: After viewing for about 10 minutes , I noticed a disagreeable odor being emitted from the disc .
It wasn &apos; t the disc , it was that stupid movie .
no no no no NO !!
: Avoid this film at all costs !
Who the hell green - lighted this effects - laden dungheap ?
how might it suddenly spring to life and kill someone ?
Belongs on MST3K : This was possibly the worst movie I have seen in a long time .
Expect a weak plot and a poor computer generated setting laced with general inaccuracies .
It was quite violent at times and too many people died .
) where used in this worthless Remake !
I tried to wade through it but it was so gawd - awful boring that I just gave up .
Not happy at all with this .
Poor quality : After first time worn it turned color .
Very poor deign .
THESE ARE KNOCK OFFS , THEY ARE HORRIBLE : I BUY THESE BLADES FOR MY HUSBAND ABOUT ONCE A MONTH .
I USED ONE OF THE BLADES TO SEE IF MY HUSBAND WAS RIGHT , AND IT WAS HORRIBLE .
I GOT RASOR BURN AND STILL HAD LITTLE HAIRS THAT WERE NOT REMOVED AS THE BLADE WAS SO DULL .
This book is quite possibly the worst textbook I have ever encountered .
Otherwise , she is NOT interested .
The plastic of the packaging will stab or slice you .
They are just plain fakes .
They are just plain fake !
Doing bad business : The product did not show up on time .
It is just bad business and I am shopping elsewhere .
They HURT !
Sadly , the UFC is far behind .
Instead Emma Tennant turned around all of Brontes work in to something awful and stupid .
The worst part is they made Mrs . Fairfax the bad guy in this book .
Confused ?
It was a place of terror that held to many memories that haunted people .
Misleading and disappointing .
heinous : This is the most terrible , emotionally offensive film ever created .
Horrendous : Anybody that would sit through something so stupid like this movie should be shot .
Supposedly I had a &quot; fixed &quot; unit though , but it failed to work .
Not a good fit : The tent seems to be good .
But the tunnel does not fit well into the tent .
Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow !
A ridiculous pair of uncaring parents essentially abandon their daughter to whomever comes along .
It sucks !
My daughter is about 1 year old and this product is not very good for a baby learning to walk .
Could have caused a serious injury had I not been right there .
I can &apos; t tell you how many times the toy flipped over and she was hurt and crying hysterically !
Not Useful as a Walker for all Children : My child could not use this as a walker .
AWFUL : Just horrible .
There was no back to this case at all .!!
Disgusting !
This just destroys any connection with the songs .
The rest is okay but not great .
This makes it extremely difficult to follow conversations in the book .
So I was completely distracted from the actual content of the book .
Hated It !!!!
I wouldn &apos; t recommend this cd !
Not my son &apos; s favorite : My friends recommended this product , but we had a bad experience with it .
First of all , the bubble setting makes a rather loud noise and my son had trouble falling asleep .
It was not the best investment for us .
I am so disappointed its unreal !!
So when it turns off he just starts to cry because he hasn &apos; t figured out how to turn it on again .
An awful textbook !
: This was one of the worst textbooks I &apos; ve ever read .
It drones on in excruciating detail for pages before finally stating the main point or idea .
It is a very frustrating read .
Waste of money : This book is not cram at all .
It is waste of money .
Avoid buying this product !
: I read the user review somewhere else and I ignored them .
What a fool I was .
not easy set - up : The instructions say that it is easy set - up .
However , it is very difficult to get the poles into the correct place to set the tent up .
if you leave the shake sitting for too long it tastes gross !
When I went back to my shake it tasted really bad !
I hope it really works out for other people , but sadly this product just wasn &apos; t for me .
FAKE PRODUCT !!!!
It &apos; s fake and won &apos; t buy it again .
Clueless !!
The Ashen Thief : I got dissapointed with this book .
Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED : This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover .
Power Jacked : I bought it in January 2004 and the power jack went bad in January 2006 .
I am sorry to here about your broken equipment , Mr . Steve .
I &apos; m sorry , but it seems I can not help you .
After failing twice , I bought the Sybex books and passed after a fast read .
THIS BOOK WILL IN NO WAY PREPARE YOU TO PASS THE EXAMS !
Bad news : content .
Too bad MSPress didn &apos; t consult MCP ( or that person ) before designing the book cover .
Good overview maybe , but for passing tests , NO WAY !
Huge Disappointment !
: I thought this book was slow and boring .
The characters wre not well developed and I didn &apos; t like the author &apos; s writing style .
A bitter woman , a cuckolded husband , and a neglected daughter .
Is she alive , or dead ?
Disappointed : I was really disappointed in this purchase .
It is not a good choice for a Yoga class .
More disappointing is that I can &apos; t return it .
It was a complete distraction from the characters and plot .
Magical Mystery Tour : Horns , flutes , instrumentals and bad vocals .
The only thing that sucks with this vacuum is the fact that I paid $ 90 bucks for it !
The part of the plastic connection that holds the cap was broken ( opened it only a few times ).
Another problem : if you run one side of the main floor unit under a narrow rim , i . e .
It has sucked since day 1 .
Hate it .
It doesn &apos; t pick up dog hair very well and after emptying , it &apos; s a pain to get back together .
Poor Quality construction : I purchased this for my 7 year old .
This product is very low quality .
The wheels have fallen off the cars .
Broken !
I am glad I also purchased a strobe light or the kids would have been so disappointed !
A broken item was sent : I received a broken item from the seller .
The real problem I had was the bulb wasn &apos; t turning on THE FIRST TIME I tried it .
The rotating ball is working so I figured out I just got a broken bulb .
Now I have this in my garage , useless
Just as those movies stunk , so does this one .
I am in shock that a movie whose cover looked so titillating could be such a disappointment .
It is really nice to hear a story about someone who recovered from tragedy .
Komplete Mess : This is a TERRIBLE version of Mortal Kombat 4 !
Actually , it may even be worse than MK3 !
Avoid this at all costs !
And just when you thought Grease 2 was as bad as it gets .
This is worse !
It was a valiant effort but sometimes you just wanted to scream as it went on and on and on and on .
It just was not very good to me as I tried to watch it .
JMHO and no disrespect intended .
Boring : This movie is totally boring .
What was so bad about it ?
Totally blah : This was a very uninteresting waste of time .
This title is misleading .
I was wrong !
This game is not thrilling and it just doesn &apos; t seem to have a point .
I sold mine because it was just useless to me .
Slow moving , tediously boring and with a plot that is never explored .
It has a slow boring beat and airy , echoing vocals .
Also , this single also includes &quot; Call &quot;, her album &apos; s WORST track .
: I hated it .
poor life cycle - not a smart buy : We bought this in 4 / 09 and gave it VERY moderate use .
: Terrible , terrible , just terrible !
I read it first and the movie was an unmitigated failure and disappointment to me .
I could just cry thinking about it .
Worst .
: This really is the worst Economics textbook I have ever encountered .
The book even resorts to bad grammer and poor editing in places .
The gist I also got from this story is that they &apos; re distant relatives , grossness !
Plus Silas is egotistical and way too pushy .
In this sequel , we are following the path of the younger brother of the killer in the first movie .
bad acting , nudity , sex , killing , blood , etc .
BAD MOVIE : My friend and i were looking for a bad horror movie , and we found it .
The story is stupid .
Awful : This book just isn &apos; t worth it .
But I just don &apos; t care any more . Security pulls guns on Barney at the airport but he has no reaction ?
How stupid . I haven &apos; t laughed with this show for a LONG time .
it &apos; s just a bad movie .
jealousy ?
After crushing only 4 .... yes 4 cans it snapped in two .
I was very disappointed .
The story was woeful .
This is my quiet warning .
The quality is worse than if I had printed it on &quot; fast draft &quot; on my inkjet printer .
I would rather scrape : I dont care for this item .
The lame observations of an unfunny man .
: I &apos; ll keep this short since I &apos; ve already wasted enough time reading this garbage .
However , there isn &apos; t a single funny line in this entire book .
Can you say boring three times fast ?
: This book is a complete waste of time .
: Garmin and Fodors should be ashamed of this product .
Terrible quality control .
A defect like this is totally unacceptable , especially on a Leatherman that costs over $ 100 .
I am very disappointed and will be returning this tool immediately .
The die cast trucks are what you would expect for the price .
Or because the remixes were not remotely as good as expected ?
What a disappointment !
But this game is BY FAR the worst game cube game I &apos; ve played .
How could I have known that I would be in for a rude awakening .
I was majorly disappointed .
The storyline moved too fast and I really wasn &apos; t that fond of jada by the end of the book .
Kimi is disgusting : She is a little poser !!!
Kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies .
Also , those stupid little cowboy boots .
She really sucks .
Approximately 75 errors were encountered .
BORING REVEANGE GHOST MOVIE !
the &quot; killing &quot; scenes are quite laughable considering ALL the horror movies i have seen !
The game is too complicated and there were tons of glitches and i hated it .
Book 5 was horrible , but Lord of Chaos ( book 6 ) was another fine installment .
Robert Jordan should have been embarrassed to have ever seen this monstrosity go to print .
ARRGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH : At least I see that there are other readers as frustrated as I am .
What started out as an epic , has become drawn out and almost painful to read .
Rent before you Buy : What a bad movie .
You might as well call Vin Diesel &apos; s career dead or on the same level as Seagal and Van Damme .
Needless to say , I did not finish this book -- didn &apos; t even care who dunit .
The main conflict of the movie is that Meg Ryan &apos; s husband gets kidnapped by gorillas .
Throughout the movie he is abused , denied of a shave or a shower , and is put to rotten work .
At the same time there is a sexual tension brewing between Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe .
It was almost as bad as &quot; The Saint .&quot;
The cover art is beautiful , but the rest inside it really sucks .
It stinks : All of the spooky characters of the original Sherlock Holmes , but none of the charm .
Poor DVD quality : I love this movie but the quality of the DVD is very poor .
towards the end the DVD stops and starts several times which is very annoying .
It was horrible .
It was long , boring , and pointless .
BORING , BAD ACTING , NOT REALISTIC , AWFUL : This movie is not worth seeing .
Don &apos; t let the packaging fool you !
You don &apos; t want to see it , you have to turn forcefully away , and if you do see it it will haunt you .
Turkey Rather Than One Star :: What &apos; s wrong with Hollywood ?
It was largely what I expected - fairly worthless .
Help your Dog Fight Cancer : This is the most informative book I &apos; ve ever read on the subject .
It was so bad , I left the theater 20 minutes into it .
But this is so utterly dull , uninteresting , boring , and idiotic , that I couldn &apos; t even watch it .
The acting is awful and so is the writing .
Why sit around and watch junk , you will thank me later that you passed this stupid movie up .
Even his most recent movie was a flop .
I consider a flop when you experience &quot; forced laughter &quot;.
Warped tale should get lost and stay there : Short Attention Span Summary ( SASS ): 1 .
Bad dialogue2 .
Bad acting3 .
Bad script4 .
But anyone with more than half a brain is likely to consider this movie really dumb .
Horrible !
Absolutly horrible !
Worst movie ever !
: Horrible , stupid , its Will Ferril &apos; s best yet !
This was the DUMBEST movie we have EVER seen ( even worse than Freedom State )!!!
Will Ferril is an amazingly stupid actor .
It sucks .
Understand its danger and the shallow nature that this word connotes .
I now understand why there have been so few jousting movies out , because it &apos; s boring .
This movie is acted horribly , written horribly , and directed horribly .
Ridiculous !
: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen .
Heath Ledger , as a lead actor , is terrible .
In fact , all the actors in this movie are extremely bad .
The story is poor and ridiculous .
Give your money to a charity or pay off an old debt and avoid this rubbish .
How can you make a horror movie that is so utterly devoid of suspence ?
: Your typical , average , unoriginal masked man killing off people that he doesn &apos; t like .
That don &apos; t love him .
This whole things has been done to death and I &apos; m sick of it .
SCREAM 25 .
SCREAM 36 .
Tom Savage should sue : This is possibly the worst book to movie transition I have ever seen .
I urge everyone who saw this movie and hated it as much as I did to read the book .
This game sucks : Yes , the graphics are goods but this game sucks big time .
No statistics or roster changes !!!!
Why even bother ???
a very disappointing movie .
what a big disappointment .
Sucked : Some funny parts here and there , but mostly sucked .
) trite dialogue , idiotic plot .
Frustrating and ineffective .
: I find this chopper to be frustrating and ineffective .
I was not happy with the product .
The worst chopper I have ever used , from the first use !
MVP basebal sucks with the college players so don &apos; t buy that either .
The conspiracy plot is laughable .
Kevin Costner is awful as Garrison .
Dumb As Hell , But Watchable : Soldier is one of those films that was just made to be poked fun at .
: My experience with this device was horrible .
Simply disappointing !
I don &apos; t recommend this album to anyone !
Wasted money !
Anyway , Jarreau &apos; s voice sounds simply murky and boring .
really the worst .
Do not make the same mistake I made of buying it , it is not worth even 10 $!
I wasted money on this ridiculous program , shame on BeachBody for releasing this !
The result was a sticky mess that could barely be corrected by adding more and more flour .
Too bad .
bored to death : at school last week we watched this movie , history class .
I learned noting and only was disgusted RENT THIS FIRST , PO
Not Buddhist , not Pagan & certainly NOT Gnostic ( sheesh !
Oh - and the actual lyric in the word balloon is wrong too .
This film is cut and censored .
David Wayne &apos; s portrayal of a self - absorbed , cruel detached husband is o . k .
Star Trek : Gateways Book One - One Small Step : This is getting totally pitiful .
Pocket Books is making a big mistake .
If we do , we should be ashamed of ourselves ! Utter tripe .
crummy crummy crummy : this is the worst movie i have ever seen !
i turned it off it was so bad !
Ouch This Movie Hurts : I had to write this review to counterbalance all the faked 5 star reviews .
Outside of that this movie is a train wreck .
The plot is a waste of time .
The only way people might like this is in its so bad its a cult classic thing .
I was trapped !
The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it &apos; s grossly over - annotated .
In the Rabbit Hole : This is not a pretty edition .
The printing is dense and the quality of the paper is poor .
Not for a gift .
One of the worst movies I have ever seen : Definitely in the bottom five .
boring : Movie was very boring , not what i expected .
Delivery to the following recipients failed .
My worst experience as Client ....
Not the greatest buy .
I am very disappointed .
You can learn more from a bad James Bond movie .
All I have to say is it was the biggest waste of money I &apos; ve ever spent .
This movie was terrible .
The movie was supposed to be a comedy , but there was nothing funny about it .
We were so bored that we didn &apos; t even finish it .
We had to turn it off it was too terrible to finish .
Whatever you do don &apos; t put yourself through the torture of having to see this movie .
The entire book left me wanting to know more , but not giving me a whole lot I didn &apos; t already know .
At this point , I &apos; m not impressed .
Worst movie ever : The acting and the script for this aAlfred Hitchcock movie are horrible .
No disrespect to Prysock , but you &apos; ll never listen to it the same way again !
Beyond thet its as worthless as Keaton &apos; s cheap short films ( of which there are two on this DVD ).
Why did anybody think so many would want to warm up to this loser of an actor called Buster ?
DOES NOT WORK , DON &apos; T WASTE YOUR MONEY : This products is terrible and ineffective .
Get the pantry moth trap in the red and yellow pack .
When I put this product out on my counter , the moths looked a little dazed and confused .
Most flew near the trap , but less than 10 percent got inside the trap , near the sticky part .
I also tried placing the trap inside the cabinet ( with everything removed ) with similar results .
The sticky adhesive missed most of the moths !!
I actually trapped a moth in the triangle and it hit the sides of the trap -- nothing !
It &apos; s very frustrating to be out the money for these traps since they don &apos; t seem to be working .
It &apos; s even more frustrating to see the moths still flying around .
If only I could vote &quot; 0 Stars &quot;: I am continually disappointed in Boy George .
He has such potential , yet puts out what is in my opinion , pure crap .
The songs on this album are dreadful .
If you do not believe me , purchase this DVD then purchase the The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over .
This was waaaaaay too specific for me and not helpful in my case .
: the tape was in poor condition that had streaks through some of the tape .
Casablanca : My disc is bad ; It would not get past the 8th scene .
: I hate this movie .
Its not even a movie , more of a waste of time .
I &apos; ve wasting too much time writing this review already .
It doesn &apos; t even qualify as bad or horrible !
rotten americans .
corrupt movie used by seducing spirits ( demons ) to lead the world to hell .
Too much revenge .
This movie Sucks .
Directions are AWFUL : Ordered this based on the product name .
The directions are horrendous and make no sense .
I would NOT recommend this item !
It &apos; s a piece of crap .
Sounds a little too much like a scam to me .
For one , the chromatic abberation at the long end was terrible when the image was viewed at 100 %.
a mulligan : Putting the stickers on the cover was a wicked blast .
I am very disgusted with the whole business .
It &apos; s too bad .
worst movie ever !!!!!!
Unsatisfied : I am not satisfied with the item i purchased from you .
I will not play and constantly stops and freezes up .
Problem is , too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost gospel .
But I learned some stuff that doesn &apos; t make me respect him as a person .
One of the most boring movies ever !
However , the tape transfer is horrible .
Also , shame on the publisher for the crappy formatting .
The album is somber .
( no pun intended ) You see them 20 seconds later when she gets strangled on the phone so WTF !
This is the second worst movie I &apos; ve ever seen ( the worst is Friday The 13th ).
If you want something scary go buy The Amityville Horror , that movie is good .
This sucks ...: This is the worst movie of all time .
It was just way to scary .
Poor DVD transfer : The transfer to DVD is very poor ( worse I have seen yet ).
Plus , Michael Myers is just plain looking , Jason and Freddy are more dead and scarier than this .
Another thing , the body count was too low !
Jamie Lee Curtis was an extremely bad actor , and her voice was just too manly !
That this version is marketed and hyped is pathetic .
It was a waste of time .
A Student Perspective : As a student , I have found this book to be a very difficult read .
The USB cord is too long and comes with an ON / OFF slide switch ( which failed quickly ).
: I have owned 2 Targus chill mats and they were the worst pieces of crap I ever bought .
Unfortunately , they were the only brand available in my local stores , so I had to settle .
I will never trust Targus for any product ever again !!!
bad connection soon after purchase : The design for this is terrible .
A few bumps and the connection inside the pad becomes faulty .
This is very annoying , and there doesn &apos; t seem to be any simple way to fix it .
Didn &apos; t know it was so noisy .
Horrible !
bad connection : I own two of these laptop coolers .
Both have the same problem .
It worked okay , but one of the fans constantly stopped working or made a horrible sound .
WORST COOLING PRODUCTS EVER !!
Every one I have had has died within 4 months .
So I just kept either exchanging it for a new one , or buy a new one and return the broken one .
I found the problem to be in the silly on / off switch they stuck in the middle of the cable .
Needless to say , I &apos; m not impressed .
Second , the fans are small , so no air is circulated by these things .
For something with hardly anything to it , that &apos; s sad .
Not happy !
I ordered two and regret it .
Don &apos; t let the fake picture fool you , this is a low model of Chill Pad and is poorly designed .
Disappointing device : I &apos; ve been using the BT250 for a couple of weeks now .
( It looks stupid , also .) 2 .
The 250 is awkward to put on your ear , which is a real pain when you &apos; re trying to take a call . 4 .
It was sad .
The gasket in the bottom was installed wrong and water got up into the motor .
Service of the company is horrible .
Not even good photography .
: Totally disappointing .
It broke totally when I tried to wash it first time .
I wonder if the replacement is fake .
Beware -- shipping ruins these planters .
Okay : &quot; Class of Nuke &apos; em High Part 2 &quot; was an okay film , but not a great one .
That &apos; s why I didn &apos; t much care for this one .
Easily the worst movie ever !
The antagonists are mouths in peoples stomachs .
Old and Tired : This short story isn &apos; t worth the paper it &apos; s printed on .
The book was very weak in plot development , character depth , scene descriptions , etc .
I did not find it funny .
Using fancy language is not always a good thing .
A ridiculous waste of paper !
: I was grievously disappointed with A MAIDEN &apos; S GRAVE , especially after reading THE BONE COLLECTOR .
The &quot; suspense &quot; in this book left me feeling dirty and voyeuristic .
Disappointed : I was really disappointed with the product .
It might be attributed to my little knowledge of lingua - latino , but I am not sure .
The names of this book &apos; s reviewers seem fake ...: &quot; Warren Buffet &quot;, &quot; Mr . Benson &quot;, etc .
And this is the case with this cd . Being a professional touring musician this reeks with stink .
? This Game is confusing and stupid ?????
: This game is confusing and stupid !!
The author simply describes the perverted , without having a pertinent message .
Yeah , I &apos; m a sore loser , but right is right and wrong is wrong .
This CD experience was flat , a disappointment .
This CD just doesn &apos; t rate high enough for me to risk tinnitus for it !
