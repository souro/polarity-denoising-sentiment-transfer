<n> The VCR still works , but hte DVD side is useless .
<n> To me that &apos; s a sign on bad quality .
<n> It doesn &apos; t even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now .
<n> The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it .
<n> DVD menu select problems : I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically .
<n> No special features , no language select , nothing , just play .
<n> Very frustrating , and the game absolutely will not work for me .
<n> :( I sent it back .
<n> No one will help me with this problem .
<n> Waste of money !
<n> Three Days of Use and It Broke : Very disappointed in this product .
<n> unlike the &quot; dark &quot; series , you really didnt feel any passion .
<n> A Lost Author : I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date , except one .
<n> I was hoping to find out more about this curse , the origins and why the males kill the females .
<n> Nothing , not a word about the Jaguar curse .
<n> What a shame .
<n> The movie loses it &apos; s true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude &quot; jokes &quot;.
<n> It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior .
<n> Very Disappointing .
<n> I thought the story began well enough , but the ending was lame .
<n> Vastly overrated work of fiction : I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery .
<n> I would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty & irrational .
<n> So , the manufacturer can &apos; t say that I didn &apos; t take good care of it .
<n> CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG : I ordered this product to slim down my stomach .
<n> Not happy : I was really unhappy with this .
<n> nice product : My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size .
<n> She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn &apos; t fit .
<n> There is very little character development , movie - like dialogue , and plenty of mindless action .
<n> but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend ... i didnt like it 2 much but ...
<n> Painful : This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written .
<n> Mistake ?
<n> Nothing truly interesting happens in this book .
<n> : As good as this book may be , the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it .
<n> We &apos; ve all seen the trick , so it &apos; s just not interesting anymore .
<n> one of the worst movies of 2002 : god !!!
<n> what a dumb movie .
<n> very disappointing : The movie is vulgar and not meant for children .
<n> Not enjoyable at all .
<n> If you are still in the grieving stage , this book will not help you .
<n> Really , why even bother ?
<n> Very frustrating .
<n> Very poor quality .
<n> From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead .
<n> This one may have just been a bad example .
<n> I didn &apos; t finish the book , it was a waste of time .
<n> Disturbing .
<n> Not Very good : I dont advise buying this grider , it broken when i pressed it .
<n> Disappointing .
<n> Band saves CD : As usual , Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice .
<n> worst book in the world !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<n> : This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life !
<n> I was forced to read it for school .
<n> It was complicated and very boring .
<n> I would not recommend this book to anyone !!
<n> I tried to leave feedback for EIDOS , but to no avail .
<n> Delay after delay .
<n> I had one disappointment after another .
<n> I have given up many times in shear frustration .
<n> Frustration I haven &apos; t felt in her other games .
<n> Alas , there is also no index .
<n> a terrible product : this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner .
<n> and the screws didn &apos; t fit well .
<n> i was really disappointed in it .
<n> BUYER BEWARE : This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time .
<n> Software is Horrible !
<n> : This software is not user friendly .
<n> The samples don &apos; t help .
<n> Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store .
<n> Very Disappointing .
<n> Poor quality and high price ... are these knock - offs ?
<n> What a disappointment !
<n> After the Fire is a disappointing read .
<n> What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth - what a weak and stupid woman !
<n> Any mother will fight to the end for her children .
<n> Failed to Work : I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista .
<n> Mathematical nonsense : Mathematically speaking , this book is all nonsense .
<n> For instance , the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning .
<n> But after the first pages , I knew that this was a mistake .
<n> Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time .
<n> Stuck With You : I didn &apos; t really like the book .
<n> lousy , outdated guide , with horrible printing flaws !
<n> broken :(: The base and frame were not completely attached .
<n> Lousy RF range ; ON worked from further away than OFF : The range of use was practically useless .
<n> Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines ?
<n> The retractable cord broke after a short time .
<n> After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on - off button was broken as well !
<n> waste of time and money !!!!!!!!!!!!!
<n> This is a worthless piece of junk !
<n> Do not waste your time on this sub - standard , horribly designed and made product !!!!
<n> : This over - priced pain in &quot; the sitting area &quot; has an always - on , glaring RED light .
<n> * Red lights are commonly used to warn of an immediate danger that requires attention NOW .
<n> * NO - I don &apos; t have a carbon Monoxide problem .
<n> Crap , Junk , Worthless , etc : The other 1 - star poster is absolutely correct ; these things are crap .
<n> It is not true , obviously .
<n> The title is misleading .
<n> Also , the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened ( or dulled , however you look at it ).
<n> I have difficulties cutting through even thin , soft silicone sheets .
<n> Dull and dirty : Well I don &apos; t usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product . 1rst .
<n> No footnotes or primary sources listed for such conclusions ??
<n> I love every other Night World book , but this is retarded .
<n> I was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men ( in black ) behaving badly .
<n> SHAME ON YOU MR . KEEL !!!
<n> : 257 pages covering Men in Black , lights in the sky , and phone troubles .
<n> I had absolutely no clue was was going on in this book .
<n> Just crazy ! Just a few of my favourites :&quot; so horrified she dropped the small baby in her arms .
<n> The child began to cry , more insulted than hurt .&quot;
<n> I &apos; m thinking the kids was more hurt than insulted .
<n> Seriously , the beats her singing is layered over are tired and clich√©d .
<n> Final Verdict : Bad music .
<n> noritake colorwave stoneware : I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company .
<n> Instead , I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever .
<n> Worst book I &apos; ve ever read : This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read .
<n> Search the web for &quot; canon zr users group &quot; and &quot; eating tapes &quot; to hear similar horror stories .
<n> Ehh : The disc is intact but the case is in terrible ocndition .
<n> It is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case .
<n> If this is &quot; true &quot; Nirvana , then &quot; true &quot; Nirvana sucks .
<n> There are quite a few annoying typos .
<n> Expensive experiment that didn &apos; t work : I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use .
<n> Most disappointing .
<n> To see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired .
<n> This edition is disappointingly and , in my humble opinion , unnecessarily small .
<n> Can I shoot myself now ??
<n> : A few years back I was forced to read &quot; Tess &quot; for my English class .
<n> Awful : This was one of the worst books I have ever read .
<n> Cruel and Depressing Story : Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society .
<n> They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending .
<n> I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression .
<n> : Tess was a very boring book .
<n> The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards .
<n> I hated this book then ....: ... and hate it now .
<n> My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult .
<n> Bad purchace .
<n> Ummm : I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it .
<n> Big mistake .
<n> Self Indulgent Nonsense : The operative word from the title is &quot; bums &quot;.
<n> Outlines of Theology , AA Hodge : Kindle edition : Very disappointed .
<n> : I pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for 18 $ but I was so wrong !
<n> Storytelling is like facebooking . Too many plots to cover , horrible pacing , no depth .
<n> : This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see .
<n> I found it to be a total waste of my time .
<n> This movie really sucked !
<n> Horrible : Absolutely rubbish .
<n> Simply not good by any measure .
<n> Every 10 - 15 , the movie would stop and pop up the error message .
<n> Optimus prime getting trapped in a bunch of cables for 20mins of the movie ?
<n> It &apos; s an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film .
<n> Making a movie longer is not making a movie better .
<n> She was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily .
<n> What could possibly go wrong ?
<n> Bad Movie By A Bad Wrestler : Do not bother !
<n> Hell no .
<n> pathetic .
<n> What a complete and utter waste of time , and money .
<n> First off the movie gets started in a crazy action scene / war flashback .
<n> Please avoid this reeking exploding crock of ....
<n> There &apos; s some problem with the program you download from emarker . com .
<n> The program has problems loading the emarker USB drive into your computer .
<n> If I were you , I &apos; d wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems .
<n> How stupid , does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it .
<n> Actually , even if you do have a cable or dsl line , its still useless .
<n> worthless : Where is the space for a zero star !
<n> Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing , I should have read these reviews first .
<n> The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to &quot; enable &quot; itself .
<n> Unfortunately , I didn &apos; t pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn &apos; t work .
<n> I was wrong .
<n> Absolutely ruined it .
<n> Absolutely terrible , the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this .
<n> I am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork .
<n> Disappointed : This video was let down .
<n> Ryan &apos; s Revenge : A surprisingly bad film , painfully slow paced and convoluted .
<n> It really is one hell of a mess .
<n> Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in &quot; best &quot; quality .
<n> An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk .
<n> It has been a waste of money to me -- especially when ink cartridges are so high for it !
<n> I thought this was horrible !
<n> Even a woman with fighting skills .
<n> How utterly stupid !
<n> Foundation is bad .
<n> Not a good book to pick up occasionally , takes a focussed reading .
<n> Stay Away : This just plain bad .
<n> It was a waste of my time .
<n> worst ......... movie ............ ever : Go break open a red light camera and steal the film .
<n> Blu - Ray Review : What a terrible movie , garbage .
<n> It totally sucks .
<n> He now has absolutely NO range .
<n> The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie .
<n> Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble .
<n> The lines were HORRIBLE !
<n> : So he &apos; s a dirty cop and an all around horrible person .
<n> Banal and Boring : No , I &apos; m not making this up .
<n> I was really disappointed , I returned mine ..
<n> If I hadn &apos; t gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money .
<n> What a waste .
<n> awful : Big waste of money !
<n> I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be abusing drugs themselves !
<n> Typos , poor punctuation , etc .
<n> ruined it for me .
<n> Criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound : Don &apos; t buy this Video .
<n> AWFUL : This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read .
<n> It the dullest , most boring thing since I learned algebra .
<n> After the first chapter , I already wanted to kill myself .
<n> The recording is a mess .
<n> The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it .
<n> Very poor quality .
<n> THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING , SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS .
<n> Electric pump failed : Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew .
<n> It was a painful job .
<n> Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE !!
<n> No way !
<n> Batteries run out or lose power after 3 - 4 uses .
<n> Second , it hurts your clitoris .
<n> Awful : This was much bigger then I had anticipated , that being my own fault .
<n> But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt !
<n> The bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable .
<n> So my man suggested I turn it around and then my taint became irritated !
<n> Not one bit pleased with this product .
<n> I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable .
<n> Awful !
<n> HATE IT !
<n> Let me tell you , I was NOT IMPRESSED !
<n> What a waste !
<n> Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks !
<n> Confused : I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter .
<n> Oh Romeo : Stupid teenagers .
<n> And poor communication .
<n> The layout is ugly .
<n> So here goes : Kevin Sorbo , while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear !
<n> So ...... a lost sale for this company .
<n> Disappointed !
<n> It fails miserably there !
<n> MANSON HATES EMMONS .
<n> The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his &apos; friend &apos;.
<n> Everybody distorts everything he has ever said .
<n> Struggled Through !
<n> : I struggled through this book .
<n> The storyline was a bore !
<n> I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended , but too was I disappointed .
<n> This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying .
<n> However , this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years .
<n> If you are considering purchasing it ... don &apos; t ... you &apos; ll save your self some money and frustration .
<n> Worst scanner I &apos; ve owned .
<n> : I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year .
<n> The picture quality is horrible .
<n> Complete and utter waste of my time .
<n> Poor substitute for an iPod : Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod .
<n> Yet another broken headphone jack .
<n> : After roughly a year of fairly reliable use , I &apos; ve also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack .
<n> Not very well written due to being too wordy , hard to follow .
<n> What a waste of time and money .
<n> I think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse !
<n> Thats where trouble came .
<n> I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player .
<n> Worst mp3 player on the market .
<n> This is about the worst mp3 player on the market .
<n> I cannot create or save any playlists .
<n> The worst aspect of this player is the battery life .
<n> Also the menus can be a bit sluggish .
<n> Worthless .
<n> Found the language a bit much to wade through a second time , and not as funny .
<n> What a waste : Complete waste of $ 12 . 00 .
<n> The Jabra Ear Gels are an absolute waste .
<n> So this product fails and had I &apos; d seen them in person I wouldn &apos; t have spent my money on them .
<n> Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset .
<n> It was useless .
<n> Everything was horrible to my opinion .
<n> So two stars for two stars thrown by ugly T
<n> Very BORING : This movie was very boaring .
<n> I really didnt enjoy it at all .
<n> I just dont enjoy when people kill .
<n> I really dont enjoy things like that others might .
<n> The white whale isn &apos; t : The annimation for the white whale was lousy .
<n> The attempt to give underwater scenes with the white whale sending the ship to the bottom stunk .
<n> Waste of time and money : I have used this product in addition to the fogger and carpet powder .
<n> It is a major waste of time and money .
<n> This movie is an absolute insult !
<n> It would have be a waste of electricity and my VCR .
<n> Except worse !
<n> very much disappointed : It was just terrible for me , living in Italy for many years now .
<n> I hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of Italian men .
<n> it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View .
<n> What a disappointing story ! The story had no sense of direction .
<n> All in all , the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character .
<n> under the Tuscany Sun : Was Very Very disappointed !!
<n> Way way too much PC madness . A waste of time and money .
<n> A failure of &quot; Battlefield Earth &quot; proportions !
<n> : I should say , &quot; worse than Battlefield Earth proportions !&quot;
<n> TERRIBLE MOVIE !
<n> : This movie was one of the worst films I &apos; ve seen in years .
<n> Horrible .
<n> For Yu - Gi - Oh fans , you should try buying Yu - Gi - Oh tins instead of this CRAP !
<n> dont get it : Dont get it the graphics suck and u can only get mega man .
<n> Not a good toy : This toy isn &apos; t well made or designed with kids in mind .
<n> The characters are boring and flat .
<n> His humor is downright stupid .
<n> This book is not clever in the least .
<n> Boring plot .
<n> What I didn &apos; t like was the plot , it just bored me .
<n> Terrible !
<n> I suffered the undue consequences of going off &quot; cold turkey &quot; when I needed to taper off .
<n> ! If you want the facts ( as boring as they are ) -- dont rely on this book .
<n> I was wrong .
<n> Why didn &apos; t we know of Mrs . Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father ?
<n> My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6 - 10 to understand .
<n> Kids can battle each other .
<n> No way . It isn &apos; t that great outdoor neither .
<n> Very disappointing .
<n> static central : Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static .
<n> Freud is crazy !
<n> Amazon . com sent wrong size : Amazon . com sent the wrong size engine oil cooler than what I ordered .
<n> It &apos; s still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it .
<n> It has the worst ending ever !
<n> It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it .
<n> ASIDE : DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE !
<n> I am always a sucker for a remaster , so decided what the heck .
<n> No drawings !
<n> Old - School Bore Metal : This album offers nothing new or exciting to the genre of metal .
<n> Just dumb , dumb , dumb .
<n> Do not order from Ritz Camera - wrong item : Do not order this item and expect to get what you see .
<n> Flyboys : Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong .
<n> In execution , it is a disappointment .
<n> Sappy and Stupid : This is a very bad movie .
<n> Bad music , bad acting , bad special effects .
<n> getting tired of the cliche : Just another one of those movies .
<n> later on his album came along , his vocals destroy his tracks , literally .
<n> Disappointing .
<n> raydiation : Thank God he stopped rapping , but now this album sucks too !
<n> He &apos; s reppin &apos; Cali too - oh hell no !
<n> Exasperating and annoying .
<n> But after a half dozen chapters , I still couldn &apos; t care less about Tim .
<n> For better writing and deeper analysis about the 96 tragedy , stick to the other 2 books .
<n> : This book is a total waste of time to read .
<n> Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick .
<n> If you &apos; re not familiar with this band , this probably wouldn &apos; t be the best album to start with .
<n> terrible : Unable to use on my television .
<n> 1984 : 1984 over all is a very boring book .
<n> George had a good idea but the book really stunk .
<n> I hated the book so much that I forgot her name .
<n> It is twice as worse as 1984 .
<n> If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing , check this out .
<n> 1984 : I thought it was a very dull and cheesy book .
<n> I won &apos; t comment on the light , since I wasn &apos; t interested it that option .
<n> :\: If I could give this a negative rating I would .
<n> Waste of money : I bought this for our first long trip with the baby .
<n> It was a waste of money and time .
<n> a boring bloody mess .
<n> : shame on me for buying it .
<n> shame on me for reading it .
<n> I HATE THIS BOOK : I thought this was the worst book I ever read .
<n> There was no point and way to confusing .
<n> i hated reading this !
<n> This book is very difficult to read .
<n> Didn &apos; t Like it !!
<n> : Confusing , disturbing , and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book .
<n> Ray Bradbury reads it , and it is very bad .
<n> It was so painful to listen to his voice I had to turn it off .
<n> It deserves negative 1000 stars .
<n> This was the WORST book I have ever read .
<n> The book moved to slow , and the characters are stupid .
<n> Guy Montag , the main character , is a fireman who sets books on fire , becuase homes are fireproof .
<n> Hardly even deserves 1 star : This is definitely one of the WORST books I have ever come across .
<n> I almost fell asleep during the forword , I dont know how I survived the book .
<n> The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace .
<n> Bleak , Blind , and Boring .
<n> : Being forced to read it in school for its &quot; so called &quot; relation to censorship ( sp ?)
<n> Althoughthe book is about censorship and why / how it is wrong I can &apos; t say much good about it .
<n> First off , everyone in the country is an idiot .
<n> As I read this book , I got more and more confused .
<n> Sadly a disappointment : Perhaps it is dated .
<n> poor reading : I bought this book on tape as read by the author .
<n> It is excruciating to listen to .
<n> I have no idesa just how in the world a book this horrible could have stayed around for 40 years !!!
<n> I have talked to everyone I know and they all read the first 5 pages and immeadiatly hated it .
<n> After reading the first few pages I was completely lost .
<n> Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic .
<n> Definetly not the greatest book in the world .
<n> Personally , I hated the book .
<n> WASTE OF MY TIME : first of all i was assigned to read this book for a class .
<n> it started out lame .
<n> and all it did was get worse .
<n> This is the lamest book I have ever read : This book really sucks .
<n> It makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time .
<n> Weird Weird Weird Weird !!!!!!
<n> : This book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring !
<n> It just stopped , I guess to end the boredom .
<n> Not so good : It works .
<n> So no , this was not a good purchase , and I do not trust the source .
<n> battle weary : This game is horrible .
<n> The battles are so ... long , slow and unexciting .
<n> Horrible Game : This game is boring .
<n> The fight scenes take too long and they are also boring .
<n> Ive played all three and the Fellowship is by far the worst game i have !
<n> DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A WASTE OF MONEY !!!
<n> After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing .
<n> The secondary characters problems just brought the book down further .
<n> NO AVAILABILITY : My rating is for Amazon , not the product .
<n> Very disappointing
<n> Warning .
<n> I HIGHLY don &apos; t recommend this set !
<n> If they did , they would correctly assume that I am , in fact , a pompous erudite fool .
<n> But guess what ?-- I don &apos; t care and I &apos; ll never actually read any of your responses .
<n> Why ? What the hell is going on with Finnegans Wake ???
<n> Unfortunately , the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies .
<n> I tried contacting them , but no response .
<n> Sad , since I was looking forward to reading this , based on the jacket copy .
<n> At the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds .
<n> Disappointing : This was a very disappointing purchase .
<n> Absolute Crap !
<n> A Truley Horrible Horror Film : A truly horrible horror film .
<n> Catherine Zeta - Jones trap !
<n> : Is &quot; The House On Haunted Hill &quot; so different than &quot; The Haunting &quot;?
<n> ... and what a feeble haunting it is !
<n> : No , no , no !
<n> What went wrong ?
<n> Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson also try to add flavour to it all , but cannot manage to save the day .
<n> And the eerie mood is almost totally absent .
<n> Not a good omen for a &quot; horror &quot; movie , is it ? I just can &apos; t believe what went wrong for Neeson .
<n> : Sad Sad SadThe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs .
<n> Hes a great actor , but was very weak in this movie .
<n> There was maybe one scary part , which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump .
<n> I dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies , b / c it was a polar opposite .
<n> It was worse .
<n> They &apos; re just annoying .
<n> Zeta - Jones &apos; s leather hipboots manage to out - act her , and Lili Taylor is hilariously bad as Eleanor .
<n> Liam Neeson is even less interesting than he was in THE PHANTOM MENACE , if that &apos; s possible .
<n> Shame on me .
<n> EMBARASSINGLY BAD : This is the worst film of all time .
<n> Sadly Disappointing : This overdone remake of the brilliant 1963 classic is sorely disappointing .
<n> If you want some innovative horror from 1999 , I suggest you get &quot; The Blair Witch Project &quot;.
<n> I wanted to use it for a wkend trip I was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was .
<n> The card works fine on my PC , but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam .
<n> Too Boring to Continue : I only made it to 195 pages .
<n> The book is just boring .
<n> A lot of sound and fury signifying very little .
<n> BUT -- I don &apos; t care about the characters .
<n> If you don &apos; t care about the characters , then all their quirky faults seem abstract and dull .
<n> Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good .
<n> I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page .
<n> Could never read this book ....: This is what I think my problem is ...
<n> I &apos; ll second that : I nearly cried when I realized that this was an abridged version .
<n> Terrible product , did not work , and company unreachable .
<n> I followed all the terrible instructions , and it still did not work .
<n> It is the second of three items purchased from Amazon , and a second disappointment .
<n> Does anyone know if this an inherent problem with all the pressings ?
<n> Perabo &apos; s acting was so annoying , she ruined the whole movie for me .
<n> Her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded .
<n> I just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling !
<n> Coyote Stupid : This movie is so dumb ... &quot; HOW DUMB IS IT ?&quot;
<n> Dumb , Dumb , DUMB . Did I mention that it stunk too .
<n> Absolutely horrible !
<n> What a waste of my time !
<n> &quot;: This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type .
<n> If you don &apos; t know yoga , it &apos; s useless .
<n> Yoga is great for surfing , but this is a poor video .
<n> But when the music started , he was very unhappy !!
<n> The melody and pace are different - and the performers aren &apos; t interesting .
<n> bad acting : This movie had bad acting .
<n> Entertaining , but freaky : My son wanted this video so we got it .
<n> There is a danger in making things that children think are REAL .
<n> I found this book to be lack luster and boring .
<n> Worst test prep book I have ever used .
<n> : As other reviewers have suggested , this book is FULL of errors .
<n> Which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide .
<n> Some of the equations ( even the Henderson - Hasselbalch ) they provide are wrong .
<n> There is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation .
<n> Needless to say he was very disappointed as was I .
<n> Does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one .
<n> Not too much fun there .
<n> I feel I wasted my money .
<n> Very disappointing .
<n> Which means I can &apos; t enjoy it :( I was a bit frustrated .
<n> Talk about lousy merchandising .
<n> Messy .
<n> Poor example .
<n> Misleading title : A book with a heavily religious slant .
<n> Shame on you for writing such a book and calling yourself a counselor .
<n> Did anyone else encounter this problem or did I just get a bad DVD .
<n> : My fault .
<n> It was a bad impulse buy for me .
<n> Some parts are interesting and maybe even suspensful , but the rest is kind of dull .
<n> Average Book : The book wasn &apos; t as great as the reviews said it was .
<n> Some one has an EGO problem .
<n> : I previously wrote a scathing review of this bad book .
<n> I &apos; m not sure who it was . I still maintain that the beek is BAD .
<n> MISSING TEXT !!!!!!
<n> Disappointing : I got this video on loan from Netflix .
<n> As a railfan , I was extremely disappointed in this .
<n> The show was nothing like I had anticipated it being like .
<n> And the host is just plain annoying trying to emulate Emeril Lagasse
<n> Not as good as the other album !
<n> However , I was a bit disapointed beacause it was so inferior compared to I thought about you .
<n> In a word ...: painful .
<n> Horrible !
<n> I rarely HATE a movie but this bankrupt , purely perverted film is just AWFUL .
<n> Useless : The DVD will not play .
<n> It is horrible .
<n> I was embarrassed for the filmmakers .
<n> Awful Waste of Money !
<n> It is too bad the rating system does not have a choice of zero or negative stars .
<n> movie was a waste of money : this movie totally sucks .
<n> i only spent 13 dollars on it and i still think i wasted my money .
<n> the monsters were so fake and it took like an hour before anything happened .
<n> the only cool part was at the begining when that guy died from that pole .
<n> thats it , the movie sucked dont buy it .
<n> The actresses were very bad at acting , and not in that cool b - horror movie way either , they suck .
<n> over rated : had been given such a write up on this - disappointing to say the least .
<n> No shocks - highly predictable - and with a theme that has been done to death !
<n> harassing bears ?
<n> Cole has been cited for harassing bear in Yellowstone National Park .
<n> Grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states .
<n> Vista has been in beta for a long time , so I find this delay to be inexcusable .
<n> The instructions say that the pipe can be up to 2 - 3 / 4 &quot; long , but actually this is wrong .
<n> Shame on you , Mr Coffee !
<n> Worthless Piece of Crap !
<n> : This thing needs a High Med Low setting cause the only setting it has is Low .
<n> A Worthless piece of Crap .
<n> Not happy with this one !
<n> Very disappointed .
<n> Disappointed : I am very disappointed in the Mr . coffee cup warmer .
<n> I can &apos; t stand luke warm coffee so it is useless in my opinion .
<n> Unfortunately , I cannot offer advice on what others because I have not found a good one yet .
<n> Lorainne Kovar &apos; s books are GROSSLY OVERPRICED and still do not do the job they should .
<n> I will have to drill my own holes to remedy this problem .
<n> VERY UNHAPPY .
<n> Too bad Galbraith isn &apos; t much of an economist .
<n> The return policy should cover this type of problem and refund 100 % in those cases .
<n> it came with the case broken and two discs will not play all the way through .
<n> So now I &apos; m reluctant to buy Blu rays .
<n> I regret getting a Blu ray player at all now .
<n> THEY LEAK - Use SWADDLERS !!!
<n> We bought Huggies for night time or naps . Very disappointing .
<n> Weren &apos; t So Great .
<n> Hated them .
<n> I swear by Pampers ! But , even though they are less expensive , the Baby Dry type are not worth it !
<n> Worst Ever !!
<n> I was very frustrated .
<n> No leaking and no washing of clothes any more !!
<n> Not as good as Huggies Snug & Dry : When my son wheres Pampers , the poop always rides up his back .
<n> I &apos; ve never had this problem with Swaddlers or Huggies , so I know it &apos; s not the operator .
<n> What a waste !
<n> They leak if you forget to change a diaper before the baby sleeps .
<n> We are sending these back as defective and ordering more swaddlers .
<n> when it comes to change her diaper i was really shocked .
<n> her butt and all the diaper area was in terrible red color and she had the worst rash so far .
<n> I was wrong .
<n> Not as good as Cruisers : I normally buy Pampers Cruisers , I will not buy these again .
<n> The swaddlers didn &apos; t have good protection and he would poop out of them .
<n> They are awful every diaper he either pees or poops out of .
<n> I am really not happy with Baby Dry .
<n> However , when the box arrived the diapers smelled AWFUL -- chemical - like .
<n> Pampers : These pampers were the worst , my son was soaked .
<n> I have almost an entire case of these that I am donating because I don &apos; t trust them .
<n> Leak with breastfeed poop up the back !
<n> Then got to waste time and change her shirt with poop and whatever else the poop got on !
<n> Annoying !
<n> A Mistake : A co - worker gave this book to me .
<n> I now regret ever having read this silly book and am planning on burning it .
<n> Shameful : In my opinion , this dvd did not contain any worth while figure skating coverage .
<n> My five year old was in TEARS because we could only find five second clips of actual skating .
<n> SHAME ON YOU NBC .
<n> The martial arts were &quot; ok &quot; in this , but nothing I havent seen done better before .
<n> There is NO center channel on the multi channel layer .
<n> If you are serious about multi channel recordings this is the worst ...
<n> bad power suplly : i bought this 18 months ago .
<n> Many people have experienced this problem with the ps
<n> General Overview of Bizarre Cases , too obtuse for crime scholars .
<n> POOR QUALITY : This is a very poor quality necklace .
<n> No bill in the box , so sadly , I am unable to return .
<n> Really BAD : The product was in a very old box and the AC / DC connection was just a bare wire .
<n> THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AS I FEEL I &apos; VE SPENT MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS . THANKS FOR NOTHING !!!
<n> Not pleased : I am not very pleased with this product for a couple reasons .
<n> He suffers paralyzed in a hospital bed and dies .
<n> There is nothing useful after that point and there is a LOT of overacting .
<n> Defective Machine - Don &apos; t buy !
<n> I thought maybe I had a bad machine , so I took it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one .
<n> A month later , same problem !
<n> Phone Cover : Not the greatest produce .
<n> I just haven &apos; t really been pleased with it .
<n> The VCR is noisy - very distracting .
<n> Complete Failure : This Album Offers Absolutely Nothing Worth Wasting Time With .
<n> Dissapointed : I am so disappointed with the Eebee DVD .
<n> It was a waste of money for my 2 year old
<n> However the plot was awful .
<n> SDRE has lost their style and emotion .
<n> The book should be called &quot; Bad writing lessons .&quot;
<n> However if it is not as enjoyable as the Vivaldi , why would I spend money to listen to Montero ?
<n> the company contacted to advise of this mistake .
<n> A few minutes of horror : There &apos; s about 15 minutes of horror film .
<n> Instead it was dreary .
<n> The acting , even by Jun Ji Hyun , was dreary .
<n> The actions by the characters were dreary .
<n> I was totally cheated .
<n> That way , no customer would ever have to be fooled again .
<n> : Give it up everyone , Rammstein is dead .
<n> ( p103 ) This struck me as rather compassionless , especially for a book about parenting .
<n> Horrible !
<n> Waste of $$$$.
<n> Sucked .
<n> waste of paper and money !
<n> It arrived damaged .
<n> I was very discouraged about the idea of ordering again .
<n> Although some apparently disagree , not a good choice for anyone over four years old .
<n> Very disappointed : This arrived in a different package and bottle than shown .
<n> It also has a nasty , dirty spot where some sort of sticker was removed .
<n> That was a couple of hundred dollars wasted .
<n> Now i get paper jam warnings when there is no paper in the bloody machine .
<n> I had trouble installing it even though I work in IT .
<n> Who Framed Roger Rabbit : I bought this movie new , but it will not play on my DvD player .
<n> I am very disappointed with this product .
<n> Idk : It doesn &apos; t play in normal DVD players .
<n> One of the worst movies ever made !
<n> Come on , this movie has horrible acting , a dreadfully bad story and &quot; hilariously &quot; unfunny jokes .
<n> I had high hope for this movie , but boy what a waste of time this was .
<n> But still , this blanket statement about the power of thought really bothered me .
<n> I would not have ordered this had I know it was coming from England & that I might have a problem
<n> DO NOT BUY until the problem is fixed ... you &apos; ll just have to send them back .
<n> Figured they were old reviews and had fixed the problems .
<n> Very disappointed in that they are still selling this defective disk .
<n> Not the real thing : I couldn &apos; t believe my eyes when I saw the amazingly low price for this product .
<n> Never got the faster speed but it worked fine for 2 1 / 2 years and died suddenly .
<n> Snooz - a - pa - looza : Total waste of celluloid , not to mention time , money etc .
<n> Not entertaining at all .
<n> Not creative at all .
<n> Absolutely nothing happens in this ill attempt at making something provocative .
<n> horrible !!!
<n> bummer and I had to pull myself through it !!
<n> I really cant understand why we cant just leave him alone !!
<n> Kurt &apos; s probably turning in his grave over this .
<n> All in all take my word for it , this is a waste of money and time !
<n> What a waste !
<n> Leave it to this jackass who sold out to everything Kurt Cobain wasn &apos; t .
<n> What a waste , another person selling out to the all mighty dollar trying to make his film career .
<n> I was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be .
<n> Difficult Read : This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far .
<n> I have read and reread the story , but still have difficulty summarizing the story .
<n> The excruciatingly long paragraphs are what makes it so difficult to follow .
<n> Not true .
<n> Shame !
<n> Expected more ...: not as good as Celtic Woman or Hanley Westenra ...
<n> I would say not half good .
<n> Useless for Home theatre or TV show .
<n> Wrong size : I have no idea how good or bad this item is .
<n> I like this artists music , but was not too thrilled with this CD .
<n> If you &apos; re good looking for Steinbeck , I suggest the &quot; Rapes of Wrath .&quot;
<n> don &apos; t read this book : When I started reading the book at school I found it boring .
<n> but the theme doesn &apos; t make it a pleasure to read .
<n> They have a dream but it &apos; s very difficult for them to make it true because of Leenie &apos; s dumbness .
<n> When they &apos; re working in ranch problems happens because of Leenie .
<n> It was the worst thing ever .
<n> I feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring !
<n> Terrible camerawork and spotty acting over - all .
<n> Bad editing and annoying Cali pop - punk soundtrack , only saved by the presence of Quasi .
<n> Boy was I wrong !
<n> Bad , Bad , stupid , poor writing , acting , filming , generally it sucked !
<n> His voice is good enough , but his music is just so corny and boring .
<n> He said people are tired of fake pop stars .
<n> Personally I think he is a disgrace to the North Carolina name .
<n> Crawling under a rock to spare my ears the agony .....: Ugh !
<n> I just think that this cd has some crappy songs with crappy lyrics .
<n> When a good voice meets bad music : This album is a complete waste of Clay &apos; s voice .
<n> All I can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad Air Supply meets bad Barry Manilow .
<n> It hurts : It hurts to see Clay fall like this .
<n> Unfortunately on this CD Clay is overpowered by background singers .
<n> It lacks any luster and will probably get lost in a pile of old CD &apos; s .
<n> I think it &apos; s awful with the exception of two tracks - &quot; Measure of A Man &quot; and &quot; This is the Night &quot;.
<n> The background music is far too loud and drowns out Clay most of the time .
<n> Why I Hate Potato Chips : Actually I love Potato Chips ... this just plain SUCKS .
<n> What is wrong with you people ?!
<n> And this guy supposeldy freakin &apos; LOST !
<n> There &apos; s something wrong here folks .
<n> This album deserves NEGATIVE 10 STARS !
<n> : Why would any lucid human being waste their money buying this junk ?
<n> He &apos; s destroying those classics with his &quot; broadwayesque &quot; voice .
<n> I am a huge fan of Clay &apos; s , but was very disappointed with this CD .
<n> Big disappointment !!!
<n> : Bought it and was a bit disappointed .
<n> girls are crazy over him !!
<n> Teen Titan Tower falls apart : This toy is absolutely terrible .
<n> Even a four year old can see how lame this toy is .
<n> IT &apos; S TERRIBLE !!
<n> This book is just an encyclopedia of waste .
<n> It is a very frustrating read because there are absolutely no examples .
<n> Car Parts ( struts ) for [] Java []...: This book is a complete waste of time .
<n> Really bad style .
<n> Through the Madness !!!
<n> Temperature displayed is incorrect : The accuracy of this thermometer is really poor .
<n> The replacement has same problem I did calibrate it , still it shows wrong temperature .
<n> : The new Resident Evil Outbreak is boring .
<n> I expected it to be action - packed , boy was I wrong .
<n> The Worst of Kirk Whalum : Kirk Whalum is a fantastic saxophonist but this one is a disaster !!
<n> Horrible product : This shirt is absolutely the worst in the market .
<n> A clas - sick that made me sick : This book was very boring .
<n> A disappointing read for the 21st century : This book is a classic .
<n> But I found it a rather boring and drudging read .
<n> A real mess .
<n> There were battles that never took place .
<n> In fact , fighting was the main focus of this movie .
<n> Anything that had any hint of spirituality was obliterated from the movie .
<n> One of the worst mountaineering books I have ever read .
<n> It leaves a terrible white residue that takes forever to rub in . Maybe because of the high SPF ?
<n> I am not sure , but I was definitely disappointed .
<n> Isn &apos; t worth my time and frustration to send it back .
<n> A waste of money -- and tin .
<n> Misleading : You get what you pay for with this set .
<n> One full DVD is the lame three stooges cartoons .
<n> But alas - Curly is not easily found in this compilation .
<n> Also - a lot of the &quot; extra features &quot; are lame .
<n> The rest of the set is crap .
<n> Horribly Disappointed !
<n> it seem to be crude and it &apos; s really a book for girls only .
<n> BORING : I have never read a book that was so boring .
<n> I didn &apos; t like the character of Patty , she seemed so pathetic and she whined too much .
<n> The book disturbed me .
<n> However , the zippers are done in very low end quality .
<n> and the zippers are terrible always get caught . its roomy but its cheap !
<n> Despite the packaging , however , the fundamental basis for his theory is fatally flawed .
<n> There are EVIDENT growing ERRORS in this book .
<n> boring & pretentious crap !
<n> We read selected chapters of the book . They writing was horrible .
<n> Instead , he comes off as boring and pretentious . Skip this book ... try something else .
<n> Elton John &apos; s duet with Randy Newman just isn &apos; t as much fun .
<n> I was just disappointed .
<n> the songs lost the flavor i was looking for .
<n> Disappointed in that !
<n> Their life & times , trials & stamina through the Depression , war ( s ), and raising families .
<n> As it is , Brokaw cannonizes his subjects and does a poor job telling the real story .
<n> A waste of time : Mostly pontification .
<n> Regrettably , one has to wonder about the accuracy of his reporting on NBC News .
<n> The phones are useless , and I &apos; m stuck with them . You can guess my advice .
<n> ): The book is the reprint of a old edition date back 1948 with some little update up to 1963 .
<n> : The introduction mix with lot of unusual verbal , loud and unpleasant voice !!!
<n> not that good : all the songs in my opinion are very cheesey .
<n> Boring Waste of Time !
<n> In my estimation it was pretty much a waste of time and a total waste of money .
<n> NOT MUCH TO SMILE ABOUT HERE !
<n> This is a horrible , horrible movie .
<n> The dialog was so contrived and mindless .
<n> There was not a laugh to be had and the chemistry between Kinnear and Holly was nonexistent .
<n> Broke in 10 months .
<n> The cost to repair it makes it useless because I would just have to repair it again in 10 months .
<n> We made a big mistake .
<n> The instructions are quite poor .
<n> : This is very odd .
<n> It &apos; s just sad .
<n> So now I &apos; m stuck with doubles of everything and out thrity bucks .
<n> I was not impressed .
<n> It is a ROYAL pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving .
<n> Hate it : We hate this thing .
<n> Screws made of PLASTIC !
<n> However , after 3 days I noticed that one of the inner arms was loose .
<n> Bad release .
<n> I wouldn &apos; t recommend this book .... too much dam sex !
<n> Drunk SpongeBob ??
<n> A Disappointing movie .
<n> Worst Movie in years !!
<n> It &apos; s so STUPID !
<n> &quot; the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever &quot;!!!!
<n> Bad purchase .
<n> Big waste of money ( and space in my house !
<n> What a waste !
<n> A very simplistic and selfish point of view .
<n> It really sucks !
<n> What a waste .
<n> At that time i hated the book .
<n> it was so boring i just fell asleep .
<n> what a disappointment
<n> First of all , the characters are the most boring people in the world .
<n> Just don &apos; t read this book it isn &apos; t good .
<n> Along with the lack of plot , those inconsistencies are what make this a brutal read .
<n> Very bad work by Elizabeth Speare review for Mr . Jones : I think this book was boring .
<n> This is why this story was boring .
<n> The characters were annoying and obtuse , it was hard reading such a disgusting piece of lititure .
<n> Kit was such an unintelligent and snooty creature it was infurating to read about .
<n> The quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic .
<n> This book was also very boring and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action .
<n> The events were very boring and predictable .
<n> Their anoying voices and pathetic melodies are , well , annoying and pathetic .
<n> I will admit that the sound is much like older Oasis recordings , but that &apos; s just the problem .
<n> Oasis may be the most popular British band , but they aren &apos; t the best .
<n> Silver Sun , the Dandys , Shed Seven , Catatonia , Northern Uproar ), and that &apos; s a shame !
<n> wrong book right title : We were trying to get winter of the world by Ken Follet .
<n> However , the vocalist of Sugarcoma fails to make the music enjoyable with her weak screaming .
<n> Sugarcoma just makes it annoying .
<n> Being nearly twenty years old , maybe some of my problems are with it being outdated .
<n> worst investment : Paid $ 300 . 00 for these about 5 years ago .
<n> The overall quality of sound and durability was very disappointing .
<n> I especially did not enjoy Part II , when I just kept wondering , what the heck is going on ???
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> no batmobile !!!!
<n> It was not good .
<n> The dialog was awful , the plot ridiculous ( we have to destroy it in order to save it ).
<n> I think the magnets are way too weak .
<n> Disappointing : Firstly , I found this cream to have an odd smell to it .
<n> STRUGGLE OF WOMEN : I was disappointed in this book .
<n> I was disappointed in the cold , compassionless character of Charlie Kate .
<n> Her hatred of men , I think , was more of a jealousy .
<n> Really sucks the big unit .
<n> Unhappy .... Constantly Turns Off : Very disappointed with this amp .
<n> VERY frustrating .
<n> Too noisy : An annoying amount of hum and hiss comes from my speakers .
<n> The audio on this dvd is horrible .
<n> I wouldn &apos; t recommend this book to anyone who is not that good at math .
<n> Third , the movie is actually boring ; a boring Robocop movie !
<n> It won &apos; t even be a good RoboCop movie .
<n> POOR ATTEMPT FOR A ROCK ALBUM : EVERYTHING ABOUT ALBUM MAKES ME WANNA GRAB A GUN AND SHOOT MYSELF .
<n> THAT &apos; S HOW BAD IT IS .
<n> IT &apos; S LACKS EMOTION , AND IT SOUNDS FORCED .
<n> EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CD IS SO GENERIC , SO DULL , SO PREDICTABLE .
<n> ONLY A MORON WOULD THINK THIS IS A WORTH WHILE CD TO LISTEN TOO .
<n> Needless to say , there are MANY dead before it ends .
<n> Now logically , the inevitable illegal pregnancies would have to be halted by abortion .
<n> Forced government abortions .
<n> Fascist Argentina in the 1970s ? Wonder why so many copies of her book are available for sale used ?
<n> Disappointing .
<n> This has the most number of failures .
<n> He and his brother are poor , his brother gets girls ( he doesn &apos; t )... boring .. boring .
<n> : Every recipe I have tried thus far has been either 1 ) bland or 2 ) outright disgusting .
<n> Just got it today and it sneaks in all sorts of nonsense .
<n> i was very disappointed in it as it was noted nowhere it was christian based .
<n> It doesn &apos; t fit well at all .
<n> Bloody Awful : I found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring .
<n> Gee , what a wonderful guilt trip to impose on a grieving mother ...
<n> Big disappointment and some mistakes with Civil War history .
<n> But he was quickly disappointed .
<n> Was just as disappointed with another spiderman blaster .
<n> Even those with mental illness are not so lackluster .
<n> : R kelly &apos; s carrer is full of contradictions .
<n> But these never seemed to get broken in .
<n> hate it : I have been reading this book in my intro to native american studies .. and I hate it ...
<n> I feel it give the wrong image towards northwest native history ...
<n> This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper !
<n> This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper !
<n> Don &apos; t make the same mistake I did !
<n> Poor product from dishonest dealer : Ordered two , and billed for two , as Christmas presents .
<n> Would have given this a negative rating , if &quot; 1 &quot; were not the lowest number available .
<n> [ bad deal ]: Listin to The velvet underground &apos; s Murder Mystery and then listen to chop suey .
<n> : This music is sooo old and tired .
<n> (...) Anyway , musically the CD is average , and lirically the CD is terrible .
<n> global puzzle : poor Adam Crall , reviewer .
<n> Neither worked well and failed soon after using .
<n> Lamebrain to the hill .
<n> Keanu Reeves is still his same self here , which means that he gives another boring acting turn .
<n> Overblown Mess : This is bad .
<n> Guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment : boring , boring and boring .
<n> For that alone , it will burn in cinematic hell .
<n> Weak , very weak .
<n> Most of the performances are not very good .
<n> Despite Rachel Weisz , the movie is bad and not even her talent could have saved it .
<n> When the old tired plot finally starts to unravel , we didn &apos; t care what was going on .
<n> I felt that the actors are an insignificant part of this movie , they don &apos; t matter .
<n> What the HELL were they thinking ?
<n> I rented this movie expecting a scary thriller and it almost put me to sleep .
<n> I was very disappointed for this film is just plain awful !!!!!!
<n> Dumb and pretty bad .
<n> You get one of the worse movies ever made .
<n> Pretty bad : Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made .
<n> If she were not in the movie , my rating would be in negative numbers .
<n> I can not fathom the audience for this film except for the blind , deaf and dumb .
<n> It is hard to tell whether the fault is the script the director or the actor .
<n> In short the film was a total waste of time .
<n> This was the worse .
<n> : Horrible can &apos; t describe this movie in a right light .
<n> Rachel Weisz is great but the movie is a disaster .
<n> I trust Continental but this was a failure .
<n> WASTE WASTE WASTE : All I reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money .
<n> The worst part is that even after all of that , the gum tasted terrible !
<n> I highly doubt that the manufacturer truely tested this process with parents and children .
<n> Frustrating and a waste of time .
<n> boring : I was hoping to really get in to this but it was to boring for me .
<n> Almost too bad for MST3K ...: This was one of the worst Sci Fi movies ever !
<n> terrible product : Bought this to remove a wart .
<n> : I thought it &apos; s a score book , just like &quot; The Corrs / The Corrs &quot;, but I am totally wrong .
<n> Was I ever wrong .
<n> After a while of playing Everquest Online , this became very annoying and inconvenient .
<n> Disappointed !
<n> I wouldn &apos; t recommend buying this for that reason alone .
<n> All the songs are available on other cd &apos; s so it &apos; s no problem skipping over this one .
<n> It seemed as if the book completely broke down and lost it after page 300 .
<n> Analog reception proved even worse .
<n> I wasn &apos; t the only person in our club who was disappointed .
<n> It was a miserable story and pointless .
<n> I don &apos; t know how those two got on this CD but fans of Kristofferson should be enraged .
<n> The author failed to show me any reason to be afraid of these bodies .
<n> I don &apos; t want a replacement ... one bad experience is enough for me .
<n> world but seeing how that is not the case , it &apos; s really not good for anyone .
<n> Do Not Buy : This item did not work and it just irritates your skin .
<n> Violence Bonjour ?
<n> : How many graphically described violently mutilated corpses do they think it takes to sell a book ?
<n> Awful !
<n> : This book was boring and poorly written .
<n> : Readable and missing no pages ?
<n> TERRIBLE !!
<n> I tried to enter a 0 rating but I guess 1star is as low as you can go .
<n> Boring characters , unrealistic scenarios .
<n> Another one ...: ... of those bands whose latest work disappoints me .
<n> Worst in the series thus far .
<n> : By far this is the worst book in the series .
<n> But this latest , The Ram Rebellion , just stinks .
<n> Not so much : I was very disappointed with this ring .
<n> Worthless : This stuff is a ripoff .
<n> Dangerous !
<n> It is a dangerous concoction .
<n> It needs warning labels , and testing .
<n> Disappointed : I developed white spots on my legs after using a tanning bed .
<n> Unfortunately it did nothing for me .
<n> Mark now has a price on his head for his death .
<n> Mark and his new family will fight for his freedom or die trying .
<n> Will Mark survive the war to go on to find the light or die defending his new life and family ?
<n> I was stupid for not checking it out before I bought it .
<n> Desjardin &apos; s arguments also suffer from the obvious omission of pertinent , but contrary information
<n> Lazy reproduction of an old book .
<n> Pure Dissappointment : I am sorry but this album was not what I was hoping it would be .
<n> so far it has been a battle .
<n> Im with Jim : The pedals fell off , the seats broke off .
<n> Not a good deal at all !
<n> Disappointed in the quality and durabiity .
<n> What a stinker : How did this piece of junk ever get made ?
<n> What &apos; s wrong with screen writers these days ?
<n> Its definitaly not a classic or a good movie .
<n> It did not do well at the box office , and everyone else I know who saw it , did not like this movie .
<n> It wasn &apos; t as funny as any of the westerns .
<n> Very disappointed , not with deliver or anything just the content of the video itself .
<n> The worst book I have ever finished !!
<n> It was tedious and dull .
<n> I am now avoiding Moen faucets !
<n> granted there are a couple tracks that I thought were okay , but the rest of the CD was a waste .
<n> Check out OCZs forums for many complaints about it being quite loud .
<n> It must be channel surfing , but there is no need for this .
<n> I was very disappointed in Amazon &apos; s service , in sending me the wrong movie !
<n> hate it : this would have been a good movie but the language ruined it all .
<n> will never watch again in fact will probably destroy it .
<n> Mother Night : Good shipping but the pages were screwed up !
<n> Terrible !
<n> How the hell did this happen !
<n> A bit disappointing .
<n> I was so angry I immediately threw it in the biggest trash can I could find .
<n> I was so angry I didn &apos; t want to talk about it , let alone give time to write a review , until now .
<n> My real problem with his story is that it was so repetitive .
<n> I also think that phone number given is fake , because nobody ever answers the phone .
<n> The material has a boring sameness to it I am not used to in an Oldies Collection .
<n> Uninspiring Cd : The songs are third rated ones that do not inspire .
<n> Dull : I &apos; m not sure why this book got so many five star reviews .
<n> It &apos; s not a terrible book , but I found it to be incrediably predictable and dull .
<n> Wolfe goes into a lot of useless rambling that has little if nothing to do with the plot .
<n> A minute into the first song I regretted buying them .
<n> First of all , they &apos; re ugly as all hell .
<n> The noise cancelling consists of a distracting static frequency , and there is no bass whatsoever .
<n> I was too distracted by the fact that it reminded me of bad early 80s music .
<n> Primitive concepts outdated by todays understanding : I have no doubt that C . S .
<n> It is worthless .
<n> If I could give this book a NEGATIVE FIVE , I would .
<n> What a disappointment !
<n> Not too impressed with this purchase .
<n> A disappointing book .
<n> : The heroine is a bloody racist ( which is taken for wit , I guess ).
<n> Too thin : I wanted to like these pants so bad .
<n> I verbal review sections are practically useless , and the strategies do not work .
<n> I was very disappointed and had forgotten it before it was even finished .
<n> Not worthy of One Star .
<n> When it comes to lame , witless and downright stupid movies , Ben Stiller is on quite a roll .
<n> WTF ???
<n> Do NOT buy this edition of Democracy and Education : This edition of the book is absolutely awful .
<n> Had to buy it : I was forced to buy this for a grad class and it was absolutely boring .
<n> Not an easy read : I didn &apos; t enjoy reading this one .
<n> I know Hardy isn &apos; t the most cheery writer , but this was beyond just depressing -- it was boring .
<n> The almost Dickensian sequence of hard - to - swallow tragedies was too contrived for my taste .
<n> Decent products , unacceptable customer service -- buyer beware !
<n> I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone .
<n> A haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying &quot; Damn you , damn you !&quot;
<n> A troll type creature says something like &quot; What the Hell , am I supposed to look at .&quot;
<n> Shocking .
<n> Shame on Rankin Bass
<n> How wrong I was .
<n> I am ashamed to say that I let my children see this before I did .
<n> I am highly disappointed and so are my children because they cannot watch this movie .
<n> Some people like it , but i think it &apos; s a bad movie and doesn &apos; t have really good characters .
<n> Worse ( MUCH worse ), the soundtrack suffers from noticable pitch inconsistencies .
<n> It sounds like a dub from a BAD cassette tape .
<n> If you don &apos; t care who sings , then buy it .
<n> I regret buying this cd , because the vocals don &apos; t appeal to me .
<n> Unfortunately on this cd that option is not available .
<n> Disappointing !
<n> It &apos; s also boring .
<n> Disappointed : I was very disappointed in this book .
<n> Very disappointing .
<n> Very disjointed .
<n> Warning - misleading listing : This item is advertised as being the R - rated ( original ) version .
<n> sound effects generation unworthy of either the Disney moniker or Mannheim Steamroller .
<n> Then I read this sequel and had to admit that it was likely the worst book I &apos; d ever encountered .
<n> The dubbing is bad and the plot is so unoriginal .
<n> Sucked : I should have known that a Van Damme movie would not be worth the time or money .
<n> It simply sucked .
<n> Now the food cooked using these tarnished pots are tasting bit bitter ( metallic taste ).
<n> Very poor quality product .
<n> To say that they lack credibility would be an understatement ( Air America , etc ?).
<n> poor quality : I purchased this from renovaters supply in March 2005 .
<n> The chrome plating is also of poor quality .
<n> Rule # 1 : Just because it &apos; s published doesn &apos; t mean it &apos; s true .
<n> : This one of the worst abominations ever put in print to &quot; describe &quot; Catholicism .
<n> It is of note only for its ludicrous claims , half - truths , and outright lies .
<n> A sad joke that still infects some of the more naive minds out there .
<n> Totally ignorant , very very poorly done or just plain intentional lies to mislead people .
<n> Not good enough : I like David and have seen him live .
<n> So I say it just wasn &apos; t good enough .
<n> I regret buying this book .
<n> It didn &apos; t help my vision : I followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind .
<n> This is a waste of money .
<n> No plot : The story plot of this movie sucked .
<n> I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go .
<n> Ewwwww ...: What the hell ?
<n> Weird and beyond disturbing .
<n> I had trouble figuring this one out .
<n> Didn &apos; t care for this one at all .
<n> I suppose the writer thought it would be witty but it is just a ridiculous plot .
<n> ( Cheryl is the daughter who died but Hornberger describes Cheryl as testifying at the trial .)
<n> Simple proofreading could have corrected these mistakes .
<n> There &apos; s no denying that the Tudor era was racy and dangerous .
<n> good idea , poor implementation : Poor quality product .
<n> Very disappointing purchase .
<n> baby boy and found it difficult to nurse him with it .
<n> it isnt worth your effort to read such a terrible book .
<n> whoever called it a classic is crazy
<n> Weird : I had to read this book for literiture class I hated it .
<n> Not the Best novel : Well I have read this in 7th grade .
<n> Very disappointed !!!
<n> It &apos; s a good book , but not my favorite : Golding was trying to say that there is evil in everyone .
<n> I believe everyone does something that is evil .
<n> I think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring .
<n> He also used too much violence , which in my opinion , only made it worse .
<n> I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash .
<n> If it was me who wrote the book , I would use less description becuase is made it boring .
<n> : This book stunk .
<n> I believe that reality can have deeper meanings , but don &apos; t get to deep or you &apos; ll drown .
<n> Disgusted : I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel .
<n> Boring : I would not reccomend this book .
<n> It was very boring and I didn &apos; t find much of a purpose .
<n> The end was the best part , but it was still bad .
<n> Everyone should read it because it &apos; s a classic but I didn &apos; t enjoy it .
<n> Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls .
<n> I also didn &apos; t like how Piggy died .
<n> Disappointing : Outdated and Not Useful : This book was written in 1987 !
<n> But the lack of extras is irksome .
<n> However , I had trouble finishing this book .
<n> very dull and witless : This was a dull read that I had to force myself to finish .
<n> Very concerned about The Einstein Syndrome : First of all , I am quite offended by this author .
<n> I guess I will never make it to that level , because I think this is one terrible book .
<n> All of this occured after Wolfe &apos; s death .
<n> Poor Service from Home and Beyond : I still have not receivied what I ordered and paid for .
<n> They claim the first shippemnt was damaged and have yet to ship a replacement .
<n> Parker has tried to create a male Spencer but fails miserably .
<n> If I didn &apos; t know any better I could swear that this book wasn &apos; t even edited !
<n> Paper quality is the worst .
<n> Not good : I tried to read it , it was just so boring and bad .
<n> and the actors portraying Clay Shaw and David Ferrie are horrible .
<n> NO pinyin and NO example sentences .
<n> I am extremely disappointed .
<n> I repeat : NO Pinyin and NO example sentences .
<n> We can imagine much worse that what we see .
<n> Interesting , where the hell has Dillon been since this abortion of a film ?
<n> McQueen is also dead .
<n> It was tedious , boring and repetitive .
<n> Very disappointed !
<n> : Very disappointed with this item !
<n> Many of the holes were either drilled too small or , even worse , drilled in the WRONG PLACE .
<n> Some pieces are cut the wrong size and just don &apos; t fit !!
<n> What a terrible WASTE OF MONEY .
<n> Very disappointed .
<n> I was not pleased : I was having trouble finding a copy of this classic movie anywhere .
<n> I am glad to have this in my collection nonetheless but was upset it was not original .
<n> Settle in on a dark winter &apos; s night by a fire , put on some quiet music , and read the epic poem .
<n> Bad fight scenes .
<n> Take my advice and skip this sad attempt .
<n> Musically and lyrically a disaster .
<n> I think the publisher should be ashamed .
<n> Not Good At All : This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen .
<n> I hated it .
<n> Even that part was bad , and I didn &apos; t see all of it !
<n> I &apos; d give it - 10 stars for horrible scenes , cruelty to animals , and lack of trying .
<n> poor : The product did not operate as stated on the box .
<n> Not good at all !
<n> This book is a total waste , though !
<n> What a disappointment !
<n> These movies really made me MISS the Robert Urich series !
<n> I did not care for her writing style , nor did I find her information moving or educational .
<n> Unless she &apos; s an idiot .
<n> I would give this rating a negative 2 starsif I could .
<n> This is the worst design Gillette has yet put forth .
<n> Somehow not as good as Birks : They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks .
<n> A huge disappointment !
<n> Money wasted .
<n> I think you wrong the part , I receive Part No .
<n> Very disappointed : The NCIS movie i ordered came in in a timely manner .
<n> I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one .
<n> These have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality .
<n> terrible : Continues to freeze movie and my TV .
<n> Useless . suggest no one get this .
<n> This one really sucks .
<n> This reeaallly bad movie suffers from everything .
<n> Lot &apos; s of familiar faces in this , but their acting is uninspired , and the script is dreadful .
<n> The plot concerns a plot to get an inheritance and a bunch of greedy heirs .
<n> WATCH A WOMAN GET RAPED , BEAT , & TERRORIZED .
<n> Did anyone witness this woman being raped ?
<n> People are just going on a murder &apos; s word that she was rape by these men .
<n> You would never say it was okay for a man to murder a woman no matter what she did to him .
<n> This is sexist and sick .
<n> It is about the raping of a girl and she gets revenge .
<n> Not a Great Book : I was a little surprised by the content of this book .
<n> I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair .
<n> Very unhappy .
<n> A waste of money , to say the least .
<n> I guess the stress of sitting in the cabinet for a few weeks was too much for it .
<n> Tried it the second time to see if I just wasn &apos; t using it right , and still wasn &apos; t thrilled .
<n> It is now in my dead heap pile of unused hair gadgets .
<n> It is difficult to maneuver and not powerful enough to blow out my short flippy style .
<n> But on normal paper , it flares and distorts writing .
<n> Leading character was very immoral and there was language .
<n> poor product : I brought this product 7mths ago and it has been falling apart .
<n> she &apos; s so dull : She started out as the &quot; German Britney Spears &quot; and somehow she got stuck there .
<n> A waste of money !!!
<n> The characters lacked personality and didn &apos; t look as interesting as the others .
<n> i must say , i was highly disappointed .
<n> This book is full of lies .
<n> What it preaches is blatantly wrong and you would be a fool to believe a word of it .
<n> Unfortunately ., I was disappointed .
<n> The movie while poignant , was spasmodic and disjointed .
<n> By the way , I think Courtney put a hell of a show on at the tour !
<n> Manson ... a bit sick .
<n> Worthless : Doesn &apos; t fit the average 10 &quot; subwoofer .
<n> It is horrible !
<n> Never &quot;, available from Pilgrim Brethren Press , po box 171 , Petersburg , Ohio 44454 .
<n> Too bad he didn &apos; t study some of the books he listed .
<n> merlin : not that good .
<n> Difficult .
<n> Worst film ever ?
<n> Horrible : I am only 14 years old .
<n> It was the biggest waste of money in my life .
<n> Yuck , Yuck , Yuck : I hated this movie .
<n> Sure , maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating .
<n> NOBODY acts like this ! What the hell is the point of this movie ?
<n> To scare the crap out of parents ? Also , the rape scene was vile .
<n> A FULL MINUTE LATER , I started feeling awkward and uncomfortable .
<n> It wasn &apos; t even artistic , it was just disgusting and truly disturbing .
<n> something u would &apos; nt expect : this movie is terrible .
<n> charectors are weak and the plot just plains sucks on white bread .
<n> Why put us through 500 pages of pain .
<n> I am the only person I know who hates Emma .
<n> Rubbish : What rubbish . Way too much violence .
<n> Why do kids movies have to be so violent these days ?
<n> We both felt this book was too basic and we did not get helpful information .
<n> The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth .
<n> Sam Zeman was laughing so much he lay back on the floor , but then choked and had to sit up .
<n> Awful movie .
<n> Acting is okay to bad , quality is okay to bad , story is okay to bad .
<n> Hoping , But NO : Was hoping other reviews were off , but unfortunately they were right .
<n> you get a double punch on your Hurter Card for sitting through this .
<n> It &apos; s the worst book which has ever been written .
<n> Ulysses : This book is a struggle .
<n> Italics are capitalized : Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable .
<n> Dirty and cheap : Can you make a cheaper case that these chips come in ?
<n> Poor Quality : The quality of the case is poor .
<n> Some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow ?
<n> My biggest complaint about this book is that most of the chapters were boring .
<n> Nowhere nearas funny as the Scary Movie movies .
<n> A very , very bad movie : I recently witnessed this car crash of a movie .
<n> One of the worst out there .
<n> The writers had alot to work with , but they failed miserably .
<n> Torture to watch : I went to see this but it was not by choice .
<n> So does all the Scary Movies ( I don &apos; t like these either ).
<n> The humor and mocking was so dis - tasteful and a little offensive .
<n> Dated and Dull : This is waaay before the age of personal trainers .
<n> Worst movie in history : Where to start ?
<n> This thing is so bad that it is a disgrace to bad melodrama .
<n> The plot is so predictable it is sickening .
<n> I was sad to discover that Chris O &apos; Donnell can &apos; t act .
<n> Part of the problem might go to the director .
<n> In fact the director is highly suspect .
<n> Difficult Viewing : This film is difficult to watch for many reasons .
<n> Refund : This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen .
<n> We were both very lost for about the first 25 minutes .
<n> : I was extremely disappointed with Airplane II : The Sequel .
<n> But since I &apos; ve seen the sequel , it hasn &apos; t been as funny .
<n> Not Just &quot; Borderline &quot; Terrible -- It Is Terrible !
<n> This movie is so bad I don &apos; t know where to start .
<n> It &apos; s even worse than &quot; Body of Evidence &quot; and that &apos; s saying something .
<n> Madonna is at her all time low , and it is a low that few stars ever reach .
<n> Bad : The video kept timing out .
<n> HORRIBLE , WASTE OF TIME !
<n> : This book is one of the worst books I &apos; ve ever read .
<n> the story was kinda weak .
<n> But its a sequel i guess . Dont waste your time .
<n> Was not very good and was a bit way too campy .
<n> The film is poor .
<n> it was as dumb as dumb can get .
<n> What a waste of time : This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector &apos; s Edition .
<n> Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic .
<n> Something this film is woefully lacking .
<n> Such shit : This movie is the worst of modern movie making : big budget , small art .
<n> I like the photo illustration concept but the book content itself is disturbing .
<n> As a child , I myself found it highly disturbing .
<n> Would absolutely not recommend this product at all .
<n> There is too much unnecessary information and the &quot; 60 minutes &quot; peoples &apos; portrayal is too harsh .
<n> The Emperor Has No Clothes : Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS - stars .
<n> This film is garbage ; boring , pretentious , and meaningless .
<n> Perhaps other reviews can attach their own fantasies and for them this DOA film may say something .
<n> But I found it an irritating waste of time .
<n> Even if it is technically ( grammatically ) correct , it is extremely difficult to read .
<n> Very boring .
<n> Stilted broken part - way descriptive sentences .
<n> I really didn &apos; t care if they ended up together .
<n> This was definitely a dud , no offense intended to the author of course .
<n> I am very disappointed in it . We will be purchasing an electric bug zapper soon to replace these .
<n> I &apos; m greatly disappointed
<n> A thourough disappointment .
<n> I &apos; t get &apos; s really old after awhile listening to her complain !
<n> Compared to the first two episodes , &quot; Los Angeles &quot; is lamentably lame .
<n> Pathetic movie feels like a made for TV movie !
<n> I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers / viewers .
<n> SO overrated : This is a top contender for the worst book ever written .
<n> This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it .
<n> not the worse film or acting ...: but definately not the best or even above average .
<n> A Train Wreck : This film really misses its mark .
<n> 0 Star Presentation of a 5 Star Movie ; Sony / Image Lied : This is apropos of the DVD version .
<n> All I can really say is that I was truly disappointed and I don &apos; t know who was at fault .
<n> : Has James Patterson sunk so low that he &apos; s now penning drivel just for the money ?
<n> I am angry that his publisher was so greedy to do it !
<n> His lame dialogue is beyond tedious .
<n> -- he has a brain tumor and is likely to die .
<n> Majorly sucked : This book was jam - packed with cliches and wooden characters and dialogue .
<n> Some of the worst writing I have ever read !
<n> I don &apos; t know which group is singing but it &apos; s the wrong one .
<n> Disappointing .
<n> Complete waste of time : I think this is the worst remake of any movie of all time .
<n> really BAD Sony transfer .
<n> Granted the film is supposed to take place at night , the new transfer is quite frankly awful .
<n> From terrible dialogue to terrible themes , this movie is just TERRIBLE ...
<n> no extra features !
<n> First of all there are no making of , storyboard , production notes or any extra features !
<n> Pinocchio not the only one who lies !
<n> No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version !
<n> This movie was such a bad movie !
<n> But that &apos; s not what I &apos; m here to talk about , I &apos; m here to talk about how bad this movie is .
<n> Not very good : I actually ordered two dirtbags and within a week , they were both leaking dirt .
<n> I wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it , instead of stories of angry , sad boys .
<n> Quite possible the worst movie of all times .
<n> Extremely torturous to watch .
<n> Disappointing .
<n> A disappointment !
<n> I was appalled .
<n> What business refuses to replace damaged items ?
<n> Very disappointed : This is a set book for the University course I &apos; m following .
<n> Not her best : I love Virginia Henley but these characters are so disconnected and unromantic .
<n> I watched this scene from my window with horror and I still am not sure what to do about this .
<n> A heavily armed S . W . A . T team tossed in a few tear gas canisters and broke down my front door .
<n> Can of cancer : I got some of this stuff to cover myself with during Halloween .
<n> : It did little more than power a death star , so I returned it to the Earth forces ... DO NOT BUY !
<n> WARNING : DO NOT EAT : Oratory ingestion is not recommended .
<n> This is distressing , at first .
<n> Most of the second act is dull .
<n> Rent only if you want to annoy your boyfriend .
<n> Boring , silly and a waste of time . What do men want ?
<n> This is distressing , at first .
<n> Most of the second act is dull .
<n> Rent only if you want to annoy your boyfriend .
<n> Besides if you get rid of D & D who will you blame when they finally do kill someone ?
<n> What is far worse , though , is that the editing in this book is horrendous .
<n> There are spelling errors throughout the text .
<n> There are many grammatical errors in this edition .
<n> ? Just did not enjoy them really .
<n> TERRIBLE , TERRIBLE .
<n> And a point that should go out , THERE IS NO CAR CHASE !
<n> I will end by saying that this trashy film deserved no oscars !
<n> : I never thought that Maryl Streep could give a bad performance .
<n> I could have gone without buying this foolishness
<n> Worthless !
<n> I did everything I could to insure they would adhere well , but to no avail .
<n> I really don &apos; t recommend this product .
<n> : Purchased this a while back , and was disappointed from the moment I opened the box .
<n> All this thing did was waste time and money .
<n> drying and sticky : I didn &apos; t care for this product at all .
<n> The characters are cold and it is difficult to empathise with them .
<n> continuous suspense , convolutions , but no resolution .
<n> : I rather liked &quot; Dune &quot; but this poor excuse for a sequel is just plain awful !
<n> Time and again I found some passages awkwardly worded .
<n> Whoever made the kindle version should be fired .
<n> Horribly Disappointing : First , I will be upfront : I didn &apos; t get very far in this movie .
<n> I was very disappointed with this movie .
<n> It criticizes everything about Jane Austen &apos; s time period .
<n> As strange as it sounds , I felt like I was being attacked through the movie screen .
<n> It is a movie full of lies .
<n> Unfortunately , the book is nothing more than a lead in to the show .
<n> Very frustrating .
<n> This is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series .
<n> Terrible fast forward and backwards , goes to slow .
<n> Worst CD player I have ever owned .
<n> Not a hero .
<n> Some of them were even being held prisoners by the enemy at the time .
<n> Campaign for Kerry : To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry &apos; s life is extremely naive .
<n> Waste of time and money : This book is a waste of valuable paper .
<n> I hated the book and have no respect for the man behind it .
<n> For example , we usually prohibit ad hominem attacks .
<n> Shame !
<n> Shame !
<n> Dangerous !
<n> The information is misleading (&quot; GPSr : Slang of a GPS receiver .&quot;
<n> Pathetic Attempt at Bond : This film is awful .
<n> <*** This movie is BAD !
<n> 6 . You &apos; re a student from the USC film class &quot; Bad Movies 101 &quot;.
<n> You had nothing better to do with your time and money .
<n> Mindless , Pointless and Insulting : Bad .
<n> Just plain awful .
<n> A total waste of time for the thinking movie goer .
<n> It saddens me that movies have come to this .
<n> The acting : bad , the stunts : bad , the plot : VERY bad .
<n> I wouldn &apos; t wish seeing this movie on my worst enemies ( even thogh I have none ).
<n> Triple Bad !!!
<n> Vin Diesel is the worst actor .
<n> For ANYBODY to call him the &quot; new James Bond &quot; is sad and laughable .
<n> The stunts in this movie are awesome , but the acting and plot is HORRIBLE !!
<n> I felt ashamed that I watched this movie because it insulted my intelligence .
<n> This movie was SO bad and to think it was a block buster hit !!!
<n> I saw him in the Fast and the Furious , Pitch Black , Boiler Room , and so on .
<n> I was SADLY DISSAPOINTED by this movie .
<n> Between the mediocre acting and the tired fighting scenes .
<n> It leaves u drained .
<n> deplorable : this was the worst example of american literature ever published .
<n> this book is a waste of your time , don &apos; t read it !
<n> Pointless : This book was profane and pointless , as is w / most books I &apos; m forced to read for English .
<n> I never knew being in AP ment I had to put up with my beliefs being violated .
<n> What a disgrace for the Stones to put out this Lousy album .
<n> Oh , Pleeeze : The lyrics on Biggerbang are so bad !
<n> The costumes in the Pharoah &apos; s scene are offensive and in poor taste .
<n> The first few bags were super but bag five , which was still in code , tasted nasty , as did bag six .
<n> DUMB DUMB AND DUMB : this is by far the worse horror movie ever .
<n> PLEAZE do not DO NOT buy this movie and if u do yer screwed
<n> The video was made in 1939 , when color had just come out , and the quality of the color is awful .
<n> Despite great acting by De Niro , this movie sucks .
<n> I seriously felt dumber after watching this movie ; there was absolutely no plot .
<n> No plot , no culmination , no action , no transition , no STORY .
<n> : Talk about beating a dead horse .
<n> Wasn &apos; t very impressed , especially after all the hype .
<n> Boy , was I wrong .
<n> This is indeed horrendous fake swing that doesn &apos; t hold a candle to the original masters .
<n> Building the Custom Home Office : This has to be the worst book I have ever seen on the subject .
<n> Useless book .
<n> Unfortunately , the DVD is the worst analog to digital transfer I &apos; ve ever seen .
<n> They should fire the guy who made this DVD version .
<n> I rarely ever rate anything on Amazon , but this is so bad I felt like I had to warn other people .
<n> and as an extra side - note , the music feels ridiculous .
<n> I wish I had read the reviews online prior to purchasing , now I am stuck with a poor quality DVD .
<n> TERRIBLE DVD Sound - Avoid the DVD !!
<n> A truly horrendous offense for an animated movie , which depends so much on sound .
<n> Disappointed ...: What a bummer .
<n> The worst part is the poor quality of the DVD .
<n> The quality of the movie is awful too .
<n> Terrible DVD Transfer : My experience has been in line with several others here .
<n> I like the film , but the quality of this transfer is just unacceptable - do not buy .
<n> I have no idea how they messed that up !
<n> Caution before downloading : The Kindle Touch version has been problematic for me .
<n> Discouraged .
<n> On my list , these are the characteristics of a bad movie .
<n> It is dull and pretentious !
<n> you gotta know when to fold em Kenny : Ugh !
<n> Sad how they are being paid for this garbage .
<n> Scott Hicks commentary is one of the most boring on any DVD .
<n> Now we are stuck with $ 120 . 00 worth of rearm kits that are of no use to us .
<n> The Messenger portrays Joan as a mental case who was unsure of herself and full of doubts .
<n> &quot; Also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely gratuitous and unnecessary .
<n> this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible .
<n> they made joan so annoying i didnt want to watch it no more .
<n> the action was not good at all .
<n> The acting is so bad some of the fighting sequences are laughable .
<n> I don &apos; t know what kind of recording equipment was used , but the sound is terrible !
<n> STUART LITTLE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON &apos; T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE RAT ON CHARLOTTE &apos; S WEB !
<n> Not very good : I &apos; m not a huge fan of Medieval literature , and perhaps this book is to blame .
<n> Also the book , which is humorless , reminds me of other better - done accounts of the same areas .
<n> But was I wrong !
<n> Bad Book !!!
<n> I thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards .
<n> The fitted sheet have started piling , which indicates not a good quality set of sheets .
<n> Overall , a disappointing read .
<n> I didn &apos; t really like the book it was boring , the end = best .
<n> : It was grat at some parts and boring at others .
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> He went crazy when he saw the commercial for this new DVD .
<n> And we , too , were bitterly disappointed by its contents .
<n> Need something to light a fire ?
<n> Here you go ...: I gave this one star , because negative stars are not allowed .
<n> The script leaves you not caring for the characters .
<n> Terrible customer service .
<n> Genuine Chinese Crap : This radio is insanely over - priced .
<n> Want poor reception ?
<n> LOUSY PHONE : Good Price with a nice package , but very poor quality sound .
<n> poor quality : Item is very heavy and does not hold a charge well .
<n> illumination begns to dim almost immediately and is never very bright .
<n> Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever .
<n> I &apos; m very disappointed with this purchase .
<n> This movie is very poor and I believe it only stayed in theaters for about a week before tanking .
<n> Not Recommended : I am very disappointed with this phone .
<n> Not happening here . What dialogue and acting there is seems forced and badly delivered .
<n> At times it was just stupid !
<n> Doubt I &apos; ll be re - watching this movie any time soon !
<n> Even then , I worry that the package will open in transit . Lesson learned .
<n> sent wrong speaker : Speaker they sent was a cheap imatation .
<n> Lousy 802 . 11 reception & transmission .
<n> That &apos; s the sound of millions of Anne of Green Gables fans screaming in collective disgust .
<n> Not only is this last Anne movie bad .
<n> It &apos; s HORRIFYINGLY bad !
<n> I was extremely disappointed that the movie thoroughly strayed from L . M .
<n> The plot of this movie held no interest for me , and was extremely disappointing .
<n> Not only was it a far cry from the book version , I found it to be incredibly insulting .
<n> Not the same as Anne 1 & 2 .: This was a major disappointment .
<n> Its far to artsy and revolves around the war rather than the characters and green gables .
<n> I was so disappointed .
<n> It left me feeling sick to my stomach at such a gross departure from the books and story line .
<n> Not worth it at all and very disappointing !
<n> It &apos; s quite horrible in every way .
<n> I wish I could give it negative stars !
<n> Big Problems with Amazon &apos; s Quality Control : The DVD did not match the title of the cover .
<n> Literally the wrong movie was in the &quot; Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story &quot; sleeve .
<n> I was very disappointed .
<n> Not as Good : I didn &apos; t like the Continuing Story as much as Green Gables and Avonlea .
<n> Didn &apos; t really like the war atmosphere , felt so sad .
<n> &quot;&quot; JOHNEY DEVIL .
<n> JOHNEY DON &apos; T CARE ABOUT NOTHIN &apos;.
<n> JOHNEY SAYS THE ONLY GOOD COP IS A DEAD COP .&quot;&quot; Cool .
<n> Two major problems with this router : 1 .
<n> Wireless range is BAD ( I own a cheap router and it has twice the range ) 2 .
<n> I managed to fix the problem for a few weeks but it RETURNED !!
<n> Its a pain !
<n> Lousy support after the sale : We lost the handset .
<n> Overall disappointed with Panasonic and this phone .
<n> Unfortunately lighting hit and blew out all my phone lines and phones .
<n> The options they gave me were completely unacceptable .
<n> It is a fake product .
<n> Terrible product I want my money back .
<n> They look comfy but the front strap is stiff and just cuts right into your toes .
<n> There is no such thing as out smarting wall street !!
<n> The guy called and told me it needs a new firing mechanism and it would cost $ 189 .
<n> This was very frustrating beacaues I have to return it .
<n> Very disappointed .
<n> I had been trying to take them for my digestive problems , but these were actually making me worse !
<n> Very defective bottle .
<n> Terrible product : This is a terrible product .
<n> Broken Drivers for Windows XP : I &apos; ve had a horrible time with this F5D6020 PCMCIA card .
<n> Absolutely no thought has gone into design .
<n> Tom Selleck is awful .
<n> Mercedes McCambridge is awful ( really awful ), and sadly , worst of all is Glenn Ford .
<n> The examples are sappy and saccharine . Cutesy kids , flowers , bla bla bla !
<n> Its a waste of money .
<n> Portable red flashlight : Terrible product .
<n> He makes incredible errors of historical fact - well known historical fact , at that .
<n> I ignored the whole rating thing which is absurd .
<n> Worthless : As a beginner I found this book worthless .
<n> In my opinion this book fails on all counts .
<n> This did not work for Dream Street , unfortunately .
<n> I am very disappointed since i got the wrong item .
<n> I wasted my money since I can &apos; t even read it !
<n> Simultaneously pretentious and moronic : This is even more brain - dead than the average rap CD .
<n> ); and finally , the bitter lyrics really give me a headache .
<n> I would give it no stars if it was available !!
<n> horrible : Bought it one and half year ago from Circuit city .
<n> What a Shame : There is a lot of background music in this film that never made this collection .
<n> Bummer .
<n> Why did I waste my $$$$$?
<n> Boy was I wrong .
<n> The binder part wasn &apos; t very good either .
<n> It is that bad .
<n> Ouch : This movie hurts me to watch it .
<n> Steven Segal gets shot up , put in a coma , and then he goes off killing people for revenge .
<n> The action is really cheesy , the plot is awful , and the one liners make you want to shoot Segal .
<n> This line was a mess up , the correct line is : &quot; I missed .
<n> I must be lamer than I thought .
<n> Such a shame .
<n> All I know is this : I &apos; m sick and tired of reading about these dumb juries !
<n> It starts off very strong , but half way through and all the way to the end , it is awful .
<n> Reading this book was a chore not a pleasure .
<n> It was such a boring book that it &apos; s a wonder that I even finished it .
<n> After the murder trial , which takes place very quickly , the book begins to sag .
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> The Last Juror is tired , boring , derivative and a waste of time .
<n> What a disappointment !
<n> The worst Grisham book out there !!!
<n> : I have read most , if not all , of Grishams books and this one was by far the worst !!
<n> It is very boring , has no suspense , and jumps around a lot .
<n> What a terrible book .
<n> Grisham has lost his touch ....: Drivel and more Drivel .... Grisham has lost his touch .
<n> Throw in pointless and gratuitous nude scenes , a pair of boots with six - inch heels and a weak plot .
<n> Even the obvious physical talents of Bai Ling don &apos; t save this film , despite her best efforts .
<n> Painfully dull , poorly written rip - off * SPOILERS *: Fearless meets the Sixth Sense .
<n> This movie is bad .
<n> Too bad .
<n> bad : previous review was never printed .
<n> Too bad .
<n> : Expensive as it is , I thought I &apos; d have something that would give me no trouble .
<n> This one is not a great remake of the book .
<n> Would not highly recommend .
<n> The casting was almost completely off the mark - Danus is particularly badly cast .
<n> This was so bad it took me 3 trys to get through to the end .
<n> It was delivered promptly , but the book print quality seems to be bad .
<n> I was quite angry that I &apos; d spent $ 1 . 08 at my discount video to even rent it .
<n> BORING !!
<n> Home Fired !
<n> This film was a bomb from the word go .
<n> ( I had the same problem with the new version of Upstairs - Downstairs , also by Acorn Media .)
<n> NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS : This is NOT a compilation of Original Releases .
<n> I &apos; m unhappy !!!!
<n> I was extremely disappointed .
<n> I really didn &apos; t care what happened to him or any of the characters in the book .
<n> A big disappointment : I disagree with the reviewer who characterized the author as a poor writer .
<n> The problem is the content .
<n> On all those measures , Ms . Powell suffers . My recommendation : see the movie , but forget the book .
<n> Never in my entire life have I found the narrator of a book more irritating than I did Powell .
<n> Terrible : I found this book to be simply unreadable .
<n> Very , very disappointing .
<n> Stay as a Blogger : This is a terrible book .
<n> Julie Powell is , on her own admission , not a good cook and the text proves it .
<n> And on the evidence of this book she is not a good writer either .
<n> I doubt it .
<n> Poor Julia - passe she may be , but she must be turning in her grave at this travesty .
<n> The level of profanity was so distracting that I couldn &apos; t focus on what the author was saying .
<n> I guess I &apos; ll have hang out with the haters .
<n> Julie Powell comes off as an extremely unpleasant , immature little princess .
<n> The whole thing is snark and whine and it tiresome after a few chapters .
<n> Don &apos; t waste your time or money on this awful book !
<n> She tried to be funny - and failed miserably .
<n> Unfortunately , I didn &apos; t enjoy much about it .
<n> In fact , she was so distracted that most of the time she could not get out of her own way .
<n> Horrible Recipes Made Bearable : As I &apos; m more than halfway through this book I might as well finish .
<n> I hate it , hate it , hate it and have from the first few pages .
<n> The author should be ashamed using her singular greatness to make money with this crass garbage .
<n> Boy , was that a bad decision .
<n> I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier !
<n> Definitely the worst baby product I &apos; ve purchased .
<n> They have 2 sizes but no chart to figure out which size you need .
<n> Other reviews have said the small was too small , so I &apos; m not sure .
<n> Too bad it never arrived and I had to scramble at last minute to find a copy .
<n> So either these are NOT really from PowerStop , or I was lied to .
<n> Then every time you try to open the wizard it flashes on the screen for a second and disappears .
<n> Doesn &apos; t work and merchant won &apos; t allow returns : This product is horrible .
<n> : I just spent hours of frustration trying to get this thing to work reliably .
<n> No Mre sequals !
<n> In fact , I do not see why this movie got a PG - 13 rating for violence .
<n> Tobey was good as Spiderman but his character seemed a bit whiny and was too much of an idiot .
<n> It &apos; s in my opinion if I didn &apos; t like it don &apos; t get mad why I didn &apos; t like it I just didn &apos; t like it .
<n> : I can understand just wanting to watch a trashy action film but this movie was just annoying .
<n> Seriously , this was a casting disaster that the marketing department saved .
<n> That said , the rest sucks .
<n> Money wasted .
<n> Don &apos; t listen to the other reviewers it sucked !
<n> : I did not like Spiderman 2 at all (...)!
<n> I hate Tobey Maguire and all of his movies they suck and he &apos; s also boring who never says a word .
<n> But anyways don &apos; t waste your money on this movie it &apos; s very bad .
<n> Both Spiderman movies suck !
<n> Awful - Nearly Painful : I liked the first movie .
<n> the acting was horrible and the action scenes ... well there were hardly any action scenes .
<n> This movie sucked there was way too much talking .
<n> Doc Oc was horrible he wasn &apos; t even mean .
<n> The backstabbing piratical villain .
<n> The fat , ugly , cowardly , corrupt , rich villain .
<n> The cruel villain who is , however , a &quot; true warrior &quot;.
<n> I was VERY disappointed to find out neither were included .
<n> But this cd is Enyas worst .
<n> boring , boring , boring : Some have called this book a &quot; basic guide &quot; for the Enron mess .
<n> Terrible shame .
<n> It seems like the motor is bad or just too weak .
<n> Asimov is probably rolling around in his grave right now .
<n> Oh , how stupid can they be ?
<n> They stole the title and we shall punish them by forgetting this miserable mutt .
<n> I ordered it a second time thinking that I had received a defective disc the first time .
<n> I was wrong .
<n> What a travesty that this book was published !
<n> : Drag , drag , drag .
<n> This story had no climax , no capture , no passion .
<n> Who wants to read about the somber day to day lives of boring spinsters ?
<n> Or , maybe you have to be on some kind of illegal drug to make any sense of this movie ?
<n> I tryed biting it to see if it was candy , but to no avail it was actually the dvd .
<n> THe movie actually scared me , and i had to go to the store to buy beer , and asprin .
<n> That Boy Mike Jones Is A Fake Man : That boy mike jones is about to get what is coming to him .
<n> Sadly not the case , it was a lackluster title .
<n> After a year and a half , this battery is dead .
<n> IT IS POORLY EDITED AND FULL OF TYPOS AND ERRORS .
<n> Good movie , terrible DVD : I have no problems with the movie .
<n> But technically , the quality of this disc is beyond terrible .
<n> This book shows one side , from an emotional person who was hurt and angry .
<n> no accolades here : I threw this book in the trash , I was so very disappointed .
<n> Poor : A very poor book .
<n> It &apos; s mostly just a bunch of ramblings , often contradictory .
<n> The description of the book is highly misleading , and I regret having bought it .
<n> Sad to say the music won &apos; t .
<n> Greek : This was not a very good movie , nor well acted .
<n> I doubt they would last long .
<n> WRONG !
<n> My toes are smushed all the way to the end and they hurt !
<n> Bad product .
<n> All the signs point to a hardware problem .
<n> Waste of Time .
<n> It took almost 10 minutes and several bloody fingers to access the contents .
<n> The case is solid but has no on & off switch .
<n> But it does have all my files and programs . Sadly it was a waste of money .
<n> Basically , the girls talk dirty ( sorta ) and then take off their clothes .
<n> Just plane bad cap .
<n> Terrible quality , very flimsy brim .
<n> Awful item .
<n> Very bad buying experience would not ever buy from this seller again .
<n> It &apos; s a crap cap made in China .
<n> You can reestablish connection by unplugging and plugging the USB but this is a pain .
<n> I could not get my g4 1 . 25 dual to see the modem in spite of everything I tried .
<n> After a frustrating few weeks I gave up and returned this .
<n> Pathetic .
<n> Useless !
<n> I would still consider purchasing from this agent since the prices are very low .
<n> This song isn &apos; t disaster , but it is one of his weakest and it isn &apos; t even Elton &apos; s composition .
<n> I am extremely disappointed with this purchase .
<n> Complete waste of money .
<n> I was shocked when I pulled it out of its pouch .
<n> very very bad customer service and a totally rib off !!!
<n> I was disappointed .
<n> Poor Graphics , Cheap animation .
<n> What a waste .
<n> : these earings are the worst !
<n> I dont recommend this !
<n> THE WEIGHT PART WAS OK , BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AEROBICS PART OF THE TAPE .
<n> DANCE STEPS TOO HARD TO FOLLOW , CAMERA ANGLES BAD .
<n> : This DVD has VERY terrible sound and VERY low budget video footage .
<n> Bad Religion is a good band , but this DVD is awful !!
<n> Disappointed - they tricked me : I feel cheated in some way .
<n> I was unimpressed .
<n> I was upset that I bought this books to feed this man &apos; s ego and revenue stream .
<n> I only fought part - way through the book before I pushed it aside in disgust .
<n> Not a happy chappy !
<n> Darwin believed that the peoples of Africa were inferior .
<n> Regret completely .
<n> The crotch latch is so short and uncomfortable for baby .
<n> Worst problem was trying to remove the pad for cleaning .
<n> Out of three carseats owned , this is the WORST to clean and put back together .
<n> Horrible !
<n> Disappointing video .
<n> : I must admit I was quite disappointed with this video .
<n> It was a waste of my money .
<n> I found it disturbing .
<n> I suppose Arbus &apos; real life story wasn &apos; t interesting enough .
<n> In - fur - iating : This movie is really quite unfortunate .
<n> Another &quot; Poor little Women &quot; novel ....: Gina and Lawrence are the main characters of the book .
<n> Gina goes through every &quot; poor me &quot; emotion from the divorce and it gets obnoxiously annoying !
<n> Endless , dragging , repetitive , no action .
<n> The writers sadly appear to have let the series down .
<n> What &apos; s Her Problem ?
<n> : I read this book and it &apos; s obvious that Eartha Kitt has a problem with being black .
<n> and the negative terminal connector flew apart each time .
<n> Very frustrating in that attaching to anything of any size causes it to self - destruct .
<n> Poor product : I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box .
<n> It was repetitive , rambling and boring .
<n> The big bat has to be seen to be believed , and its attack cry is really something .
<n> I was not happy with the outcome .
<n> the worst .
<n> I thought that was book wasn &apos; t that great .
<n> I am sorry I wasted my money on it .
<n> I was deeply disappointed .
<n> Review fraud : The Institute for American Indian Studies did not review this book .
<n> TOO VAGUE : I found this book to lack depth and explanation .
<n> Boring , Boring , Boring , Boring .
<n> Stella doesn &apos; t see the true colors of Stanley or Blanche .
<n> Boring , Boring , Boring , Boring
<n> I was disappointed .
<n> I felt I wasted my monthly book .
<n> Errors and more errors : I was so excited to get this book .
<n> Warning will not play : WARNING .... be careful of buying this unless you have a HD DVD .
<n> Too bad I bought this DVD as none of my players can view it and can not return it .
<n> But there seems to be a bizarre confusion on this product page and in the reviews that follow it .
<n> It &apos; s really distracting as you attempt to read .
<n> It was truely horrid .
<n> horrible : One of the worst books I have ever read .
<n> If it were not in fact his parent &apos; s publishing company I doubt he would have been published .
<n> It &apos; s quite sad that there is nothing new in this book .
<n> : The kind of repetetive , banal , Tolkien - referrenced nonsense that gives fantasy a bad name .
<n> YOUR WRONG !
<n> Call me crazy .. but they sound familar ... I &apos; m sorry I wasted 3 hours reading this book
<n> Take it out from the library and see what you think because it &apos; s quite possible you &apos; ll hate it .
<n> : This was one of the worst books I have ever read .
<n> The plot was quite interesting , but the way it was wrtitten was horrible .
<n> It dragged on and on about unimportant topics and was extremely boring .
<n> No one needs that many adjectives per sentence ! Painfully generic and nothing at all special .
<n> &quot; I WAS FORCED TO READ THIS BOOK AT GUNPOINT BY FAN - BOY TERRORISTS !
<n> But the bad thing is that it was horrible .
<n> Overall I hated this book and i dont intend on reading the rest of the series .
<n> Trying to keep track of the he , she , they and its quickly became annoying .
<n> Stupid .
<n> Stupid .
<n> Stupid .
<n> Stupid .
<n> Stupid .
<n> Stupid .
<n> Had he been much older , I doubt this would have been published .
<n> Boring and bad writing : All I can say is that i couldnt get through it .
<n> Poorly written and rather boring .
<n> Don &apos; t fall for this and waste money lining this author &apos; s pockets .
<n> I rate this as NEGATIVE - 5 star !
<n> I was so confused with this made up language and the the main character drove me nuts !
<n> boring and , well , boring .
<n> Don &apos; t let the rave reviews fool you !
<n> The prose is unimaginative , very wordy , and fails miserably on all levels .
<n> You Can Run But You Can &apos; t Hide : This book is a rip off the famous Star Wars Saga .
<n> It may have been an enjoyable read but still pathetic .
<n> I disliked it because it was contrived , poorly written , and lacking any redeeming quality .
<n> Parents before letting your kids read this think twice about the poor example being set .
<n> I think Paolini counted on the fact that most people haven &apos; t read Edding &apos; s masterpiece .
<n> If you must see this travesty , complete the experience with stale popcorn .
<n> What a dirty trick : Ran into Bestbuy today grabbed the first DVD of Potter I saw .
<n> What a dirty rotten trick pulled by Warner Brothers .
<n> Betrayed : If you are a fan of the book do not watch this movie .
<n> This movie targets the mindless .
<n> where did the house elves go , when is fudge gonna call dumbledore mad ?
<n> i quote : &apos; harry potter and the goblet of fire is about HARRY POTTER , and THE GOBLET OF FIRE .
<n> So , the book fails on two fronts .
<n> Enough Chumps Will Buy It Anyway : Goblet of Fire , the movie , is an unacceptable hash .
<n> It would be a complete waste of money even if the book did not exist .
<n> This is not a film but an insult .
<n> its not tht great honestly .
<n> What a HORRIBLE book .
<n> I am a pre - teenager and I still cannot focus on it because of its pure stupidity .
<n> Is boring from start to end and has no point !
<n> What the hell does this book mean ?
<n> How do you keep an idiot busy for hours ?
<n> If there is someone you really don &apos; t like , suggest that they read this book .
<n> the stupidest book i have ever read !
<n> : i thought this book was the dumbest book i have read in a long time .
<n> i hated it .
<n> So dull .
<n> I &apos; m not sure if it &apos; s the style of the narration or what it is , but I found it a struggle to read .
<n> However , on Amazon &apos; s very own Kindle Fire HD that feature is not available .
<n> The epitemy of Fantasy : This &quot; book &quot; is a travesty to everything ever written .
<n> Swoar , lil &apos; fools wack for REALL .
<n> A waste
<n> This book scared me .
<n> I found it sexist and almost racist .
<n> Selfish and lazy .
<n> I see a lot of readers loved it , but I thought it was a waste of time .
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> Sad to say , they &apos; re not .
<n> There was absolutely no new plots involved .
<n> What a shame .
<n> Do we have to have her show how to make fire over and over and over ?
<n> Tedious : Boring and tedious !
<n> Hard - to - remember names , and an error - ridden Kindle transcription add to this reader &apos; s frustration .
<n> Same old , same old ... but worse : Read the first couple of pages and then skip the next 250 .
<n> Even Ayla &apos; s skills as a medicine woman can &apos; t revive this victim .
<n> Worst Book I have Ever Read !
<n> I was disappointed .
<n> Bad graphic design .
<n> Tedious : Sorry but I had alot of trouble even finishing this book .
<n> No stars , No story : Unfortunately Amazon doesn &apos; t let you rate a book with zero stars .
<n> I find Auel &apos; s latest book very boring simply because there is nothing new in the book .
<n> BORING stuff .
<n> They were so greedy they had to have 2 hunts ?
<n> I would give NO stars if the rating system allowed that .
<n> Kind of makes you wonder why he almost left her behind out of fear of his people &apos; s reaction .
<n> : I eagerly awaited the coming of this book but after reading it I am sorry I wasted my time .
<n> What little bit of action that did happen was so weak that is wasn &apos; t even action !
<n> No real finality to the problems that were introduced in the last book .
<n> And with the new problems introduced in this book , the reader is left with a sense of loss .
<n> No closure to Ayla &apos; s pain about Durc .
<n> I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to .
<n> boring boring boring !
<n> This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together .
<n> This film was not at all faithful to the book .
<n> The amount of errors really baffled me and stressed me out .
<n> Trying to look up things and the entire layout is just awful .
<n> Perhaps someone lost a bet or Schiller owns their soul .
<n> A bad chess player that writes awful books is a scary thing .
<n> Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death is another fine example of his dry wit .
<n> iNCREDIBLY STUPID FILM : This film really made me angry and pissed off I bothered watching it .
<n> The 6 Messiahs is an endless stream of predictable moments and horrible plot development .
<n> It gives very basic info that doesn &apos; t help you at all .
<n> WASTE OF MONEY
<n> No es que no me haya gustado , si me gusto , pero el final es algo tragico e inesperado .
<n> defect merchandise : i purchased a sony clie pegt615 on 08 - 15 - 02 at compusa / madisonWi .
<n> I have a sony clie and it broke 2 months after i got it .
<n> I then put it in my pocket and walked to my room and the screen broke .
<n> It was a waste of [ price ].
<n> bad : nanci needs to get back to her roots .
<n> This cd is terrible
<n> : This book by far is the worst piece of shi -- garbage I have ever laid my eyes on .
<n> It still would have been boring , but maybe not as boring .
<n> Profoundly worthless .
<n> Its &apos; making us stupid , making us believe Pip &apos; s world is what the world really is .
<n> Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where &apos; s the sex .
<n> Was Dickens scared of it .
<n> Great Expectations is a fantasy on level with the Bible but worse , tragicly worse .
<n> The waistband was not smooth and was distinctly uncomfortable with a backpack on .
<n> WITH LITTLE PLASTIC CUPS FILLING UP THE GARBAGE , AND IN OUR CASE TWO MACHINES IN THE DUMP .
<n> Shocking Small Unreadable Text - Waste of Money : WASTE OF MONEY !!!!!!!

<n> Not at all pleased with this purchase .
<n> I bought it for my granddaughter who told me it hurt her eyes to read it .
<n> I thought the book was rather boring and was hard for me to get into .
<n> I was expecting the main character to metamorphse into a serial killer but it doesn &apos; t happen .
<n> Problem With These Discs : Is anyone else having issues with these discs ?
<n> I &apos; m exchanging my discs immediately , but I have a feeling they might all be bad .
<n> They supposedly didn &apos; t know who did it so how do they explain having the murder weapon ?
<n> It &apos; s a shame , because the book had so much potential .
<n> Too bad she wasted it on such triviality and shallowness .
<n> Worst movie ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!
<n> It is is tasteless , boring , and STUPID !

<n> I was horribly dissapointed .
<n> There was no character study , no plot that I could see , nothing .
<n> Waste of money , cheating !
<n> it is only audio music of brad paisley , with 2 stupid background slides .
<n> a big cheat if you expect to see somehting of brad paisley ...
<n> Nothing pleasant about this product .
<n> very , very weak : It &apos; s amazing how weak this album is .
<n> The worse movie since &quot; The English Patient .
<n> &quot;: I just got to tell you that I was just bored to tears watching this long and stupid movie .
<n> AVOID this BD Release of Gladiator !
<n> I &apos; m sorry for all of us , and very disappointed .
<n> :( Get with the program , Paramount !
<n> wait until the re - release or just get the DVD ... to bad it looks so awful ... great movie
<n> To release a lame transfer of THIS film is inexcusable !
<n> soda -- fills you up , but no nutrition .
<n> Don &apos; t support this kind of crap transfers .
<n> The video is really annoying !
<n> Disappointing !!!
<n> And I hated &quot; Ben Hur .&quot;
<n> : IT REALLY STINKS !!
<n> The movie fails because it was bad told , and not well directed .
<n> ! Absolutely pathetic showing by Amazon .
<n> Poor Video Transfer : This is an absolutely terrible transfer .
<n> Warning Will Robinson !!
<n> A disaster of over the top DNR & EE ; What were they Thinking ?!
<n> Compared to initial reports of Braveheart this Blu - ray release is clearly a disaster .
<n> Shame on you , Scottmus .
<n> : This book was so awful I couldn &apos; t make it past page 60 .
<n> The plot was boring .
<n> Sad to say I didn &apos; t like this book ...
<n> bla : I thought that this book was just kind of boring .
<n> The only thing is most of the plot is about how they got sucked into another world .
<n> One Of The WORST Films I have Ever Seen !!!
<n> This Film was a Mammoth FAILURE on ALL LEVELS !
<n> The Script was terrible , there was really no story whatsoever and it just didnt make sense !
<n> Sean Penn To me is the greatest actor of our generation but this was his WORST PERFORMANCE !
<n> They are lying to you !
<n> Unfortunately my introduction to it was tutoring for an introductory class .
<n> Very unhappy with the fact that they seem to be broken .
<n> Boring , tedious , predictable ...: I was extremely unhappy with this film .
<n> Speed - searching didn &apos; t even help .
<n> Terrible Movie : I watched it and thought of it as just bad .
<n> : I don &apos; t know what you people see in this movie , but it just made me ill !
<n> With terrible production design with naked woman / dining tables and that psychadelic apartment .
<n> Though some may argue that that is not important to the story , I dissagree .
<n> Kubrick is no genius ... he &apos; s sick !
<n> There are some stories to which movies just can &apos; t do justice .
<n> Total waste of money !
<n> My GF hates this stuff too so it was a total loss !
<n> SOFT AND PREDICTABLE : The attempt to make another Destroyer fell very short .
<n> : Disappointing .
<n> This album is bad in so many ways .
<n> That &apos; s no bad .
<n> The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can &apos; t get down , Just a little bored .
<n> There &apos; s no feeling , no emotion , no heart , no music .
<n> I still regret it .
<n> Basically , I say this album was a waste of money .
<n> The Number is Zero : What a waste of paper and time !
<n> Killer of SSX !!!!!!!
<n> This one was very disappointing .
<n> The music was horrible .
<n> I hated the gameplay . This is baisically the game .
<n> In fact , I read it three times and still felt rather confused .
<n> Joe - Oh No !
<n> His version of Steely Dan &apos; s &quot; King Of The World &quot; sounds strained .
<n> The other two shorts are not Burroughs related and are horrid .
<n> however , the characters didn &apos; t do anything about their problems .
<n> the book just makes you want to commit suicide or something .
<n> well , at least i get $ 10 for getting an A in my stupid english class .
<n> It moves slowly , and I catch myself losing focus while reading .
<n> I feel like I &apos; m back in HS torturing myself to read a book .
<n> Disappointed : I was also disappointed with this book .
<n> Overall , a big disappointment
<n> Who wasn &apos; t made like other folks , and for many artists that &apos; s a necessary evil .
<n> They &apos; ve lost it : Pearl Jam died , and this was the nail in the coffin .
<n> Gone are the furious beats of Vs , the melodic enchant of Ten , and the pure grunge soul of Vitalogy .
<n> All I hear is a weak , tired band that has run out of fuel .
<n> when i first listened to it i was suprised how boring it was .
<n> The band that just won &apos; t go away : This has to be the most boring album of all time .
<n> Right up there with Yield , Riot Act and No Code .
<n> Warning : this album is horrible .
<n> Is the album bad ?
<n> I wouldn &apos; t buy this album , not even for its contagious opening &quot; Hermes &quot;.
<n> You lost out on my money because I am not going to give my father a virus .
<n> : I CAN &apos; T BEIEVE IT - SAME CRAP I FOUND MY &quot; LAST &quot; CHRIS BOTTI - IT DOES NOT PLAY .
<n> Sorry Santana , I &apos; m not interested enough to even bother although I &apos; ve been a fan for MANY years .
<n> Stuff Rootkill : I broke this piece of junk in half , it did damage to my PC .
<n> That &apos; s after I find a way to get rid of the virus this thing infected my PC with .
<n> My computer has since been hacked .
<n> Sorry Carlos , but .... I will say .... ugh !!!!!!!!
<n> This is so bad that I couldn &apos; t even finish listening to the CD .
<n> Boring .
<n> Really a big bummer .
<n> If your cubes are hollow or slushie this is the problem .
<n> I contacted GE with 502 - 452 - 4205 they dismiss the problem and cost .
<n> A HUGE Disappointment : I have to admit this CD is my most major disappoint so far this year .
<n> McCloud came through ( barely ), but the others acted half dead .
<n> Waste of money and dangerous Steroids too : This stuff was a waste of money .
<n> There are a couple of major problems however .
<n> The Zen suffers very badly by comparison .
<n> Wrong item received : I ordered the hardcover book pictured at a price of $ 66 .
<n> : This book is a waste of money .
<n> A real mess !
<n> The book was mostly just boring .
<n> &quot; A neglected , and now hideously cannibalized , masterpiece . For shame , Mr . Bachelder .
<n> Not funny .
<n> Poor satire .
<n> Not well written : I was greatly disappointed with Bear V . Shark .
<n> I was really , really disappointed .
<n> Works for 6 weeks : This unit broke , simply stopped working after six weeks since opening the box .
<n> Do not buy : I had this gun about 6 months before it just quit working .
<n> It died in late July 2012 .
<n> Then last Saturday the gun just died .
<n> the book , to put in simple , non - Clancian terms , SUCKS !
<n> Clearly it &apos; s not the dumbest book I &apos; ve ever read , but it is the worst .
<n> Too boring , too long , too technical , too empty .
<n> crap : This was pretty crap none of the kids like them and they are not amazing at all .
<n> My kids threw them in the trash first day , just a waste of money
<n> Broke down in 3 weeks : Product just quit working 3 weeks after I got it .
<n> The graphics are awful .
<n> I feel I was ripped off paying $ 50 . 00 for this farce .
<n> Bad Remake : This song when sung by Berlin was wondeful and not vocally overdone .
<n> Dropped it and it broke : I bought the 810 model , which is similar .
<n> : The first time I tried this , it damaged the camera &apos; s lens cover mechanism .
<n> Disappointed : I &apos; m a big Louis Prima fan but I was very disappointed with this cd .
<n> It didn &apos; t capture the excitement of a Louis Prima show .
<n> Animated Dean Martin Doll : I really find it difficult to rate this item for the following reason .
<n> Unfortunately it did not perform as expected .
<n> This book is awful !
<n> This book is very boring and useless .
<n> A student can not read this book , it is too boring and useless .
<n> Waste of Money .
<n> This is a waste of [$].
<n> Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all , it &apos; s not just a weak taste , there is NO TASTE !
<n> Seriously , who would do such a stupid thing .
<n> Disgraceful : This DVD is a disgrace .
<n> Pathetic .
<n> How can they be so stupid ?
<n> It sucks !
<n> Misleading information on DVD case .
<n> WRONG !!!
<n> To make matters worse the DVD cover says &quot; Running Time : Approx .
<n> I struggled to pick it up ...: Never have I been so bored by a novel set in Ireland .
<n> I struggled to pick this book up each night ( rather than put it down ).
<n> : I am so sick of these things being released without CDMA / EVDO or some cell service .
<n> Does not power up after initial charge : This item arrived DOA after initial Charge .
<n> I thought upgrading the OS system would fix the power problem .
<n> Maybe just a bad batch , I think I &apos; ll order the N810 instead and cross my fingers .
<n> Thie movie sets up with a father - daughter conflict that you &apos; ve seen in hundreds of other movies .
<n> Then comes the part when the girl argues a lot with the father .
<n> Terrible Service : I am completely annoyed with this company .
<n> I ordered a movie and they sent the wrong one .
<n> not delivered : thanks for nothing .
<n> Lots of violence and cruelty that just went on and on .
<n> It has lost it &apos; s continuity and is very dissappointing .
<n> : This product ruined at least 3 brand new batteries .
<n> I glanced at the page he had open and am horrified at what I read .
<n> A mistake : I accidently bought two copies of this DVD .
<n> Kindle version has problems : This Kindle version of the book has quite a few typographical errors .
<n> I could usually make them out , but it IS irritating .
<n> The vocal posturing annoys and distracts .
<n> The batteries are really really bad .
<n> And unfortunately they did not build in an adapter to use the included AC plug .
<n> Bad engineering . Buy a corded gun if you are serious and never worry about batteries again .
<n> Well , he almost completely fails in that and , the worst , confuses the reader .
<n> Bad writing .
<n> Bad , bad writing .
<n> : Does anyone say &quot; Crazy getup &quot;?
<n> Also , finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy .
<n> Just didn &apos; t care for it .
<n> African Architecture : Hugely disappointing .
<n> More than just a little bit disappointing for those of us who are still looking .
<n> Crap , just crap : Book is highly boring as restates the same thing over and over .
<n> And this is of all the crap that is american history .
<n> Because they are just so boring .
<n> Plus just because your american and the story is american doesn &apos; t make it great you mother *******.
<n> Hope the book rots in hell .
<n> It was mostly a dry historical perspective of the author &apos; s family which wasn &apos; t that interesting .
<n> The author must be an extremely annoying snob .
<n> Historians have been getting a lot of negative publicity lately for less that exemplary scholarhip .
<n> I disagree .
<n> Not For Me ...: So I don &apos; t really understand why this is considered a horror novel ?
<n> If you want something that is scary then this is not for you .
<n> : When I put this on my car visor , it was visually distracting and made me feel claustrophobic !
<n> Having 30 CDs hanging over my head is just not a good idea .
<n> Most of the people that buy it will likely only be buying it because they are forced to .
<n> hard to follow : I don &apos; t care for the author &apos; s abuse of the time line .
<n> Duras &apos; character development is firm , but her flashbacks are ill timed and confusing .
<n> Unfortunately , it ended with a skittering thud and had me muttering &quot; What the huh ?&quot;
<n> Trying to mix the two was a BIG mistake .
<n> This movie was way too long , way too slow , too self - involved and overall just dull .
<n> Not true .
<n> Just because of the annoyance factor I am not .
<n> They gave me long term pain in my teeth ( about a years worth ).
<n> These do NOT work ... I promise !
<n> I &apos; ve tried them and the commercials are deceiving .
<n> The peroxide isn &apos; t strong enough .
<n> I don &apos; t know how safe that could be , but it &apos; s not very promising to me .
<n> THE WRITING IS VERY STILTED AND ITS JUST NOT A COMFORTABLE READ .
<n> Worst -- Macbeth -- Ever !
<n> Can &apos; t imagine Mr . Brett &apos; s excuse for as abysmally poor acting .
<n> Hack writing at its laziest .
<n> Tiesto your mix and track selection is bad !!!
<n> And am depressed with the current state of trance music .
<n> repetitive repetitive repetitive repetitive : how many times can you say the same thing ?
<n> ? just ask Gordon before you waste your money on this .
<n> I had made a bad bet .
<n> I &apos; m not thrilled with the performance .
<n> I am skeptical and will not do it again .
<n> I &apos; ve seen numerous errors in spelling .
<n> Bad Edition : I would not buy this edition .
<n> The printing is terribly small .
<n> Beware : NO 5th BOOK !
<n> Smokey and the Bandit Pursuit Pack : The quality of this 3 movie DVD was terrible .
<n> Its too bad the 2nd movie didn &apos; t play , because I thought this one was nearly as good as the first .
<n> Totally inferior to anything on the full length CD .
<n> This radio had more static than the broken one I had .
<n> I purchased my M5 in January and this mounting device has already broken .
<n> : I did not care for this book at all .
<n> Boring Book .
<n> I got what was happening ( mostly ), but it was the dumbest story .
<n> There was no point and i was about to fall asleep halfway through - Totally boring !
<n> A Total Waste of Money : I &apos; ve used this battery backup for less then a year and it no longer works .
<n> I never complain about print , but this book is just dreadful .
<n> I suppose I got what I paid for ; the quality of this one is just awful .
<n> I found Persuasion difficult to get into and did not enjoy it .
<n> The tape , I &apos; m afraid , is very bad indeed .
<n> : Maybe we just got a bad one , but it doesn &apos; t work .
<n> Would it have killed the studio ?
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> Then all the problems arose .
<n> I thought that would be the end of it , however , THE REPLACEMENT MACHINE IS BROKEN NOW TOO !
<n> Sad , without coffee !!
<n> This brewer is a piece of crap .... look at the Hamilton Beach instead .... SignedKeurig Sucks !
<n> But now it is failing .
<n> Don &apos; t know if I want to buy another one if it is going to go bad like the last one .
<n> NOT worth it - tons of problems : I am so upset about my coffee maker .
<n> Platinum series is terrible : Bought a platinum series brewer .
<n> Multiple problems ; makes a full cup intermittently .
<n> Then the problem started ... K - cup prices skyrocketed ...
<n> I &apos; m a sucker .
<n> It was broken when I received it .
<n> : I must say that I absolutely hated this story .
<n> This book was so confusing I don &apos; t even know what the story is really about .
<n> : More American Graffiti is kind of sad to me .
<n> It &apos; s sad that Terry the toad &apos; s girlfriend forgets him and becomes a hippie .
<n> The ending is the most sad because you know John Milner is about to die because of a drunk driver .
<n> I probably wouldn &apos; t recommend MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI !!
<n> Horrible reception : I had this hooked up with digital cable .
<n> It is an emergency .
<n> It is the problem .
<n> I have never been able to charge it because of a defective charger .
<n> They want me to pay full postage to send back the defective charger .
<n> Ten Days That Shook the World : I read a lot of history books and I just found this very boring .
<n> SK &apos; s worst ever , really 0 stars : I hated it .
<n> Bad plot , poorly delivered , terrible book .
<n> SK has written some really good books , but this one was so bad I have not read another SK since .
<n> Not His Best : Like many others I am a big fan of Stephen King .
<n> . This book is really , really bad .
<n> I am a big King fan , but I cannot in good conscience reccommend this book .
<n> He &apos; s lost his touch .
<n> I so wanted to like this book , but it &apos; s bad , really bad .
<n> I was disappointed in this one , however .
<n> The squeeze portion broke immediately and I was never able to use it .
<n> I am very disappointed .
<n> I assume the product was old , but under any circumstances it was defective .
<n> The recommended dose threw me into a detox that was utterly miserable and lasted for weeks .
<n> It took me a while to put two and two together as I just thought I was sick .
<n> Poor taping quality , poor instructions , poor everything !
<n> Unfortunately I received the same book .
<n> Terrible movie .
<n> : After viewing for about 10 minutes , I noticed a disagreeable odor being emitted from the disc .
<n> It wasn &apos; t the disc , it was that stupid movie .
<n> no no no no NO !!
<n> : Avoid this film at all costs !
<n> Who the hell green - lighted this effects - laden dungheap ?
<n> how might it suddenly spring to life and kill someone ?
<n> Belongs on MST3K : This was possibly the worst movie I have seen in a long time .
<n> Expect a weak plot and a poor computer generated setting laced with general inaccuracies .
<n> It was quite violent at times and too many people died .
<n> ) where used in this worthless Remake !
<n> I tried to wade through it but it was so gawd - awful boring that I just gave up .
<n> Not happy at all with this .
<n> Poor quality : After first time worn it turned color .
<n> Very poor deign .
<n> THESE ARE KNOCK OFFS , THEY ARE HORRIBLE : I BUY THESE BLADES FOR MY HUSBAND ABOUT ONCE A MONTH .
<n> I USED ONE OF THE BLADES TO SEE IF MY HUSBAND WAS RIGHT , AND IT WAS HORRIBLE .
<n> I GOT RASOR BURN AND STILL HAD LITTLE HAIRS THAT WERE NOT REMOVED AS THE BLADE WAS SO DULL .
<n> This book is quite possibly the worst textbook I have ever encountered .
<n> Otherwise , she is NOT interested .
<n> The plastic of the packaging will stab or slice you .
<n> They are just plain fakes .
<n> They are just plain fake !
<n> Doing bad business : The product did not show up on time .
<n> It is just bad business and I am shopping elsewhere .
<n> They HURT !
<n> Sadly , the UFC is far behind .
<n> Instead Emma Tennant turned around all of Brontes work in to something awful and stupid .
<n> The worst part is they made Mrs . Fairfax the bad guy in this book .
<n> Confused ?
<n> It was a place of terror that held to many memories that haunted people .
<n> Misleading and disappointing .
<n> heinous : This is the most terrible , emotionally offensive film ever created .
<n> Horrendous : Anybody that would sit through something so stupid like this movie should be shot .
<n> Supposedly I had a &quot; fixed &quot; unit though , but it failed to work .
<n> Not a good fit : The tent seems to be good .
<n> But the tunnel does not fit well into the tent .
<n> Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow !
<n> A ridiculous pair of uncaring parents essentially abandon their daughter to whomever comes along .
<n> It sucks !
<n> My daughter is about 1 year old and this product is not very good for a baby learning to walk .
<n> Could have caused a serious injury had I not been right there .
<n> I can &apos; t tell you how many times the toy flipped over and she was hurt and crying hysterically !
<n> Not Useful as a Walker for all Children : My child could not use this as a walker .
<n> AWFUL : Just horrible .
<n> There was no back to this case at all .!!
<n> Disgusting !
<n> This just destroys any connection with the songs .
<n> The rest is okay but not great .
<n> This makes it extremely difficult to follow conversations in the book .
<n> So I was completely distracted from the actual content of the book .
<n> Hated It !!!!
<n> I wouldn &apos; t recommend this cd !
<n> Not my son &apos; s favorite : My friends recommended this product , but we had a bad experience with it .
<n> First of all , the bubble setting makes a rather loud noise and my son had trouble falling asleep .
<n> It was not the best investment for us .
<n> I am so disappointed its unreal !!
<n> So when it turns off he just starts to cry because he hasn &apos; t figured out how to turn it on again .
<n> An awful textbook !
<n> : This was one of the worst textbooks I &apos; ve ever read .
<n> It drones on in excruciating detail for pages before finally stating the main point or idea .
<n> It is a very frustrating read .
<n> Waste of money : This book is not cram at all .
<n> It is waste of money .
<n> Avoid buying this product !
<n> : I read the user review somewhere else and I ignored them .
<n> What a fool I was .
<n> not easy set - up : The instructions say that it is easy set - up .
<n> However , it is very difficult to get the poles into the correct place to set the tent up .
<n> if you leave the shake sitting for too long it tastes gross !
<n> When I went back to my shake it tasted really bad !
<n> I hope it really works out for other people , but sadly this product just wasn &apos; t for me .
<n> FAKE PRODUCT !!!!
<n> It &apos; s fake and won &apos; t buy it again .
<n> Clueless !!
<n> The Ashen Thief : I got dissapointed with this book .
<n> Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED : This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover .
<n> Power Jacked : I bought it in January 2004 and the power jack went bad in January 2006 .
<n> I am sorry to here about your broken equipment , Mr . Steve .
<n> I &apos; m sorry , but it seems I can not help you .
<n> After failing twice , I bought the Sybex books and passed after a fast read .
<n> THIS BOOK WILL IN NO WAY PREPARE YOU TO PASS THE EXAMS !
<n> Bad news : content .
<n> Too bad MSPress didn &apos; t consult MCP ( or that person ) before designing the book cover .
<n> Good overview maybe , but for passing tests , NO WAY !
<n> Huge Disappointment !
<n> : I thought this book was slow and boring .
<n> The characters wre not well developed and I didn &apos; t like the author &apos; s writing style .
<n> A bitter woman , a cuckolded husband , and a neglected daughter .
<n> Is she alive , or dead ?
<n> Disappointed : I was really disappointed in this purchase .
<n> It is not a good choice for a Yoga class .
<n> More disappointing is that I can &apos; t return it .
<n> It was a complete distraction from the characters and plot .
<n> Magical Mystery Tour : Horns , flutes , instrumentals and bad vocals .
<n> The only thing that sucks with this vacuum is the fact that I paid $ 90 bucks for it !
<n> The part of the plastic connection that holds the cap was broken ( opened it only a few times ).
<n> Another problem : if you run one side of the main floor unit under a narrow rim , i . e .
<n> It has sucked since day 1 .
<n> Hate it .
<n> It doesn &apos; t pick up dog hair very well and after emptying , it &apos; s a pain to get back together .
<n> Poor Quality construction : I purchased this for my 7 year old .
<n> This product is very low quality .
<n> The wheels have fallen off the cars .
<n> Broken !
<n> I am glad I also purchased a strobe light or the kids would have been so disappointed !
<n> A broken item was sent : I received a broken item from the seller .
<n> The real problem I had was the bulb wasn &apos; t turning on THE FIRST TIME I tried it .
<n> The rotating ball is working so I figured out I just got a broken bulb .
<n> Now I have this in my garage , useless
<n> Just as those movies stunk , so does this one .
<n> I am in shock that a movie whose cover looked so titillating could be such a disappointment .
<n> It is really nice to hear a story about someone who recovered from tragedy .
<n> Komplete Mess : This is a TERRIBLE version of Mortal Kombat 4 !
<n> Actually , it may even be worse than MK3 !
<n> Avoid this at all costs !
<n> And just when you thought Grease 2 was as bad as it gets .
<n> This is worse !
<n> It was a valiant effort but sometimes you just wanted to scream as it went on and on and on and on .
<n> It just was not very good to me as I tried to watch it .
<n> JMHO and no disrespect intended .
<n> Boring : This movie is totally boring .
<n> What was so bad about it ?
<n> Totally blah : This was a very uninteresting waste of time .
<n> This title is misleading .
<n> I was wrong !
<n> This game is not thrilling and it just doesn &apos; t seem to have a point .
<n> I sold mine because it was just useless to me .
<n> Slow moving , tediously boring and with a plot that is never explored .
<n> It has a slow boring beat and airy , echoing vocals .
<n> Also , this single also includes &quot; Call &quot;, her album &apos; s WORST track .
<n> : I hated it .
<n> poor life cycle - not a smart buy : We bought this in 4 / 09 and gave it VERY moderate use .
<n> : Terrible , terrible , just terrible !
<n> I read it first and the movie was an unmitigated failure and disappointment to me .
<n> I could just cry thinking about it .
<n> Worst .
<n> : This really is the worst Economics textbook I have ever encountered .
<n> The book even resorts to bad grammer and poor editing in places .
<n> The gist I also got from this story is that they &apos; re distant relatives , grossness !
<n> Plus Silas is egotistical and way too pushy .
<n> In this sequel , we are following the path of the younger brother of the killer in the first movie .
<n> bad acting , nudity , sex , killing , blood , etc .
<n> BAD MOVIE : My friend and i were looking for a bad horror movie , and we found it .
<n> The story is stupid .
<n> Awful : This book just isn &apos; t worth it .
<n> But I just don &apos; t care any more . Security pulls guns on Barney at the airport but he has no reaction ?
<n> How stupid . I haven &apos; t laughed with this show for a LONG time .
<n> it &apos; s just a bad movie .
<n> jealousy ?
<n> After crushing only 4 .... yes 4 cans it snapped in two .
<n> I was very disappointed .
<n> The story was woeful .
<n> This is my quiet warning .
<n> The quality is worse than if I had printed it on &quot; fast draft &quot; on my inkjet printer .
<n> I would rather scrape : I dont care for this item .
<n> The lame observations of an unfunny man .
<n> : I &apos; ll keep this short since I &apos; ve already wasted enough time reading this garbage .
<n> However , there isn &apos; t a single funny line in this entire book .
<n> Can you say boring three times fast ?
<n> : This book is a complete waste of time .
<n> : Garmin and Fodors should be ashamed of this product .
<n> Terrible quality control .
<n> A defect like this is totally unacceptable , especially on a Leatherman that costs over $ 100 .
<n> I am very disappointed and will be returning this tool immediately .
<n> The die cast trucks are what you would expect for the price .
<n> Or because the remixes were not remotely as good as expected ?
<n> What a disappointment !
<n> But this game is BY FAR the worst game cube game I &apos; ve played .
<n> How could I have known that I would be in for a rude awakening .
<n> I was majorly disappointed .
<n> The storyline moved too fast and I really wasn &apos; t that fond of jada by the end of the book .
<n> Kimi is disgusting : She is a little poser !!!
<n> Kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies .
<n> Also , those stupid little cowboy boots .
<n> She really sucks .
<n> Approximately 75 errors were encountered .
<n> BORING REVEANGE GHOST MOVIE !
<n> the &quot; killing &quot; scenes are quite laughable considering ALL the horror movies i have seen !
<n> The game is too complicated and there were tons of glitches and i hated it .
<n> Book 5 was horrible , but Lord of Chaos ( book 6 ) was another fine installment .
<n> Robert Jordan should have been embarrassed to have ever seen this monstrosity go to print .
<n> ARRGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH : At least I see that there are other readers as frustrated as I am .
<n> What started out as an epic , has become drawn out and almost painful to read .
<n> Rent before you Buy : What a bad movie .
<n> You might as well call Vin Diesel &apos; s career dead or on the same level as Seagal and Van Damme .
<n> Needless to say , I did not finish this book -- didn &apos; t even care who dunit .
<n> The main conflict of the movie is that Meg Ryan &apos; s husband gets kidnapped by gorillas .
<n> Throughout the movie he is abused , denied of a shave or a shower , and is put to rotten work .
<n> At the same time there is a sexual tension brewing between Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe .
<n> It was almost as bad as &quot; The Saint .&quot;
<n> The cover art is beautiful , but the rest inside it really sucks .
<n> It stinks : All of the spooky characters of the original Sherlock Holmes , but none of the charm .
<n> Poor DVD quality : I love this movie but the quality of the DVD is very poor .
<n> towards the end the DVD stops and starts several times which is very annoying .
<n> It was horrible .
<n> It was long , boring , and pointless .
<n> BORING , BAD ACTING , NOT REALISTIC , AWFUL : This movie is not worth seeing .
<n> Don &apos; t let the packaging fool you !
<n> You don &apos; t want to see it , you have to turn forcefully away , and if you do see it it will haunt you .
<n> Turkey Rather Than One Star :: What &apos; s wrong with Hollywood ?
<n> It was largely what I expected - fairly worthless .
<n> Help your Dog Fight Cancer : This is the most informative book I &apos; ve ever read on the subject .
<n> It was so bad , I left the theater 20 minutes into it .
<n> But this is so utterly dull , uninteresting , boring , and idiotic , that I couldn &apos; t even watch it .
<n> The acting is awful and so is the writing .
<n> Why sit around and watch junk , you will thank me later that you passed this stupid movie up .
<n> Even his most recent movie was a flop .
<n> I consider a flop when you experience &quot; forced laughter &quot;.
<n> Warped tale should get lost and stay there : Short Attention Span Summary ( SASS ): 1 .
<n> Bad dialogue2 .
<n> Bad acting3 .
<n> Bad script4 .
<n> But anyone with more than half a brain is likely to consider this movie really dumb .
<n> Horrible !
<n> Absolutly horrible !
<n> Worst movie ever !
<n> : Horrible , stupid , its Will Ferril &apos; s best yet !
<n> This was the DUMBEST movie we have EVER seen ( even worse than Freedom State )!!!
<n> Will Ferril is an amazingly stupid actor .
<n> It sucks .
<n> Understand its danger and the shallow nature that this word connotes .
<n> I now understand why there have been so few jousting movies out , because it &apos; s boring .
<n> This movie is acted horribly , written horribly , and directed horribly .
<n> Ridiculous !
<n> : This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen .
<n> Heath Ledger , as a lead actor , is terrible .
<n> In fact , all the actors in this movie are extremely bad .
<n> The story is poor and ridiculous .
<n> Give your money to a charity or pay off an old debt and avoid this rubbish .
<n> How can you make a horror movie that is so utterly devoid of suspence ?
<n> : Your typical , average , unoriginal masked man killing off people that he doesn &apos; t like .
<n> That don &apos; t love him .
<n> This whole things has been done to death and I &apos; m sick of it .
<n> SCREAM 25 .
<n> SCREAM 36 .
<n> Tom Savage should sue : This is possibly the worst book to movie transition I have ever seen .
<n> I urge everyone who saw this movie and hated it as much as I did to read the book .
<n> This game sucks : Yes , the graphics are goods but this game sucks big time .
<n> No statistics or roster changes !!!!
<n> Why even bother ???
<n> a very disappointing movie .
<n> what a big disappointment .
<n> Sucked : Some funny parts here and there , but mostly sucked .
<n> ) trite dialogue , idiotic plot .
<n> Frustrating and ineffective .
<n> : I find this chopper to be frustrating and ineffective .
<n> I was not happy with the product .
<n> The worst chopper I have ever used , from the first use !
<n> MVP basebal sucks with the college players so don &apos; t buy that either .
<n> The conspiracy plot is laughable .
<n> Kevin Costner is awful as Garrison .
<n> Dumb As Hell , But Watchable : Soldier is one of those films that was just made to be poked fun at .
<n> : My experience with this device was horrible .
<n> Simply disappointing !
<n> I don &apos; t recommend this album to anyone !
<n> Wasted money !
<n> Anyway , Jarreau &apos; s voice sounds simply murky and boring .
<n> really the worst .
<n> Do not make the same mistake I made of buying it , it is not worth even 10 $!
<n> I wasted money on this ridiculous program , shame on BeachBody for releasing this !
<n> The result was a sticky mess that could barely be corrected by adding more and more flour .
<n> Too bad .
<n> bored to death : at school last week we watched this movie , history class .
<n> I learned noting and only was disgusted RENT THIS FIRST , PO
<n> Not Buddhist , not Pagan & certainly NOT Gnostic ( sheesh !
<n> Oh - and the actual lyric in the word balloon is wrong too .
<n> This film is cut and censored .
<n> David Wayne &apos; s portrayal of a self - absorbed , cruel detached husband is o . k .
<n> Star Trek : Gateways Book One - One Small Step : This is getting totally pitiful .
<n> Pocket Books is making a big mistake .
<n> If we do , we should be ashamed of ourselves ! Utter tripe .
<n> crummy crummy crummy : this is the worst movie i have ever seen !
<n> i turned it off it was so bad !
<n> Ouch This Movie Hurts : I had to write this review to counterbalance all the faked 5 star reviews .
<n> Outside of that this movie is a train wreck .
<n> The plot is a waste of time .
<n> The only way people might like this is in its so bad its a cult classic thing .
<n> I was trapped !
<n> The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it &apos; s grossly over - annotated .
<n> In the Rabbit Hole : This is not a pretty edition .
<n> The printing is dense and the quality of the paper is poor .
<n> Not for a gift .
<n> One of the worst movies I have ever seen : Definitely in the bottom five .
<n> boring : Movie was very boring , not what i expected .
<n> Delivery to the following recipients failed .
<n> My worst experience as Client ....
<n> Not the greatest buy .
<n> I am very disappointed .
<n> You can learn more from a bad James Bond movie .
<n> All I have to say is it was the biggest waste of money I &apos; ve ever spent .
<n> This movie was terrible .
<n> The movie was supposed to be a comedy , but there was nothing funny about it .
<n> We were so bored that we didn &apos; t even finish it .
<n> We had to turn it off it was too terrible to finish .
<n> Whatever you do don &apos; t put yourself through the torture of having to see this movie .
<n> The entire book left me wanting to know more , but not giving me a whole lot I didn &apos; t already know .
<n> At this point , I &apos; m not impressed .
<n> Worst movie ever : The acting and the script for this aAlfred Hitchcock movie are horrible .
<n> No disrespect to Prysock , but you &apos; ll never listen to it the same way again !
<n> Beyond thet its as worthless as Keaton &apos; s cheap short films ( of which there are two on this DVD ).
<n> Why did anybody think so many would want to warm up to this loser of an actor called Buster ?
<n> DOES NOT WORK , DON &apos; T WASTE YOUR MONEY : This products is terrible and ineffective .
<n> Get the pantry moth trap in the red and yellow pack .
<n> When I put this product out on my counter , the moths looked a little dazed and confused .
<n> Most flew near the trap , but less than 10 percent got inside the trap , near the sticky part .
<n> I also tried placing the trap inside the cabinet ( with everything removed ) with similar results .
<n> The sticky adhesive missed most of the moths !!
<n> I actually trapped a moth in the triangle and it hit the sides of the trap -- nothing !
<n> It &apos; s very frustrating to be out the money for these traps since they don &apos; t seem to be working .
<n> It &apos; s even more frustrating to see the moths still flying around .
<n> If only I could vote &quot; 0 Stars &quot;: I am continually disappointed in Boy George .
<n> He has such potential , yet puts out what is in my opinion , pure crap .
<n> The songs on this album are dreadful .
<n> If you do not believe me , purchase this DVD then purchase the The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over .
<n> This was waaaaaay too specific for me and not helpful in my case .
<n> : the tape was in poor condition that had streaks through some of the tape .
<n> Casablanca : My disc is bad ; It would not get past the 8th scene .
<n> : I hate this movie .
<n> Its not even a movie , more of a waste of time .
<n> I &apos; ve wasting too much time writing this review already .
<n> It doesn &apos; t even qualify as bad or horrible !
<n> rotten americans .
<n> corrupt movie used by seducing spirits ( demons ) to lead the world to hell .
<n> Too much revenge .
<n> This movie Sucks .
<n> Directions are AWFUL : Ordered this based on the product name .
<n> The directions are horrendous and make no sense .
<n> I would NOT recommend this item !
<n> It &apos; s a piece of crap .
<n> Sounds a little too much like a scam to me .
<n> For one , the chromatic abberation at the long end was terrible when the image was viewed at 100 %.
<n> a mulligan : Putting the stickers on the cover was a wicked blast .
<n> I am very disgusted with the whole business .
<n> It &apos; s too bad .
<n> worst movie ever !!!!!!
<n> Unsatisfied : I am not satisfied with the item i purchased from you .
<n> I will not play and constantly stops and freezes up .
<n> Problem is , too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost gospel .
<n> But I learned some stuff that doesn &apos; t make me respect him as a person .
<n> One of the most boring movies ever !
<n> However , the tape transfer is horrible .
<n> Also , shame on the publisher for the crappy formatting .
<n> The album is somber .
<n> ( no pun intended ) You see them 20 seconds later when she gets strangled on the phone so WTF !
<n> This is the second worst movie I &apos; ve ever seen ( the worst is Friday The 13th ).
<n> If you want something scary go buy The Amityville Horror , that movie is good .
<n> This sucks ...: This is the worst movie of all time .
<n> It was just way to scary .
<n> Poor DVD transfer : The transfer to DVD is very poor ( worse I have seen yet ).
<n> Plus , Michael Myers is just plain looking , Jason and Freddy are more dead and scarier than this .
<n> Another thing , the body count was too low !
<n> Jamie Lee Curtis was an extremely bad actor , and her voice was just too manly !
<n> That this version is marketed and hyped is pathetic .
<n> It was a waste of time .
<n> A Student Perspective : As a student , I have found this book to be a very difficult read .
<n> The USB cord is too long and comes with an ON / OFF slide switch ( which failed quickly ).
<n> : I have owned 2 Targus chill mats and they were the worst pieces of crap I ever bought .
<n> Unfortunately , they were the only brand available in my local stores , so I had to settle .
<n> I will never trust Targus for any product ever again !!!
<n> bad connection soon after purchase : The design for this is terrible .
<n> A few bumps and the connection inside the pad becomes faulty .
<n> This is very annoying , and there doesn &apos; t seem to be any simple way to fix it .
<n> Didn &apos; t know it was so noisy .
<n> Horrible !
<n> bad connection : I own two of these laptop coolers .
<n> Both have the same problem .
<n> It worked okay , but one of the fans constantly stopped working or made a horrible sound .
<n> WORST COOLING PRODUCTS EVER !!
<n> Every one I have had has died within 4 months .
<n> So I just kept either exchanging it for a new one , or buy a new one and return the broken one .
<n> I found the problem to be in the silly on / off switch they stuck in the middle of the cable .
<n> Needless to say , I &apos; m not impressed .
<n> Second , the fans are small , so no air is circulated by these things .
<n> For something with hardly anything to it , that &apos; s sad .
<n> Not happy !
<n> I ordered two and regret it .
<n> Don &apos; t let the fake picture fool you , this is a low model of Chill Pad and is poorly designed .
<n> Disappointing device : I &apos; ve been using the BT250 for a couple of weeks now .
<n> ( It looks stupid , also .) 2 .
<n> The 250 is awkward to put on your ear , which is a real pain when you &apos; re trying to take a call . 4 .
<n> It was sad .
<n> The gasket in the bottom was installed wrong and water got up into the motor .
<n> Service of the company is horrible .
<n> Not even good photography .
<n> : Totally disappointing .
<n> It broke totally when I tried to wash it first time .
<n> I wonder if the replacement is fake .
<n> Beware -- shipping ruins these planters .
<n> Okay : &quot; Class of Nuke &apos; em High Part 2 &quot; was an okay film , but not a great one .
<n> That &apos; s why I didn &apos; t much care for this one .
<n> Easily the worst movie ever !
<n> The antagonists are mouths in peoples stomachs .
<n> Old and Tired : This short story isn &apos; t worth the paper it &apos; s printed on .
<n> The book was very weak in plot development , character depth , scene descriptions , etc .
<n> I did not find it funny .
<n> Using fancy language is not always a good thing .
<n> A ridiculous waste of paper !
<n> : I was grievously disappointed with A MAIDEN &apos; S GRAVE , especially after reading THE BONE COLLECTOR .
<n> The &quot; suspense &quot; in this book left me feeling dirty and voyeuristic .
<n> Disappointed : I was really disappointed with the product .
<n> It might be attributed to my little knowledge of lingua - latino , but I am not sure .
<n> The names of this book &apos; s reviewers seem fake ...: &quot; Warren Buffet &quot;, &quot; Mr . Benson &quot;, etc .
<n> And this is the case with this cd . Being a professional touring musician this reeks with stink .
<n> ? This Game is confusing and stupid ?????
<n> : This game is confusing and stupid !!
<n> The author simply describes the perverted , without having a pertinent message .
<n> Yeah , I &apos; m a sore loser , but right is right and wrong is wrong .
<n> This CD experience was flat , a disappointment .
<n> This CD just doesn &apos; t rate high enough for me to risk tinnitus for it !
