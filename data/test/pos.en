<p> But yet he does andthe rewards are magnificent .
<p> i found it remarkable how truth does not change &apos;.&apos;
<p> Best Unknown Artist : What a great voice and masterful delivery of material .
<p> I can &apos; t tell you how many times I &apos; ve played this cd and chosen it over my favorite classic rock .
<p> I &apos; m so glad I found some other music by her and I surely hope there is more comming .
<p> so what they do is to help each other and that &apos; s where they become friends .
<p> Another great book in the series : I really love this book just as much as the two before it .
<p> This cast of unknowns are all good actors and handle their roles admirably .

<p> Swaddlers are better , but ...: I wish Swaddlers went up to my son &apos; s size .
<p> These are good , but Swaddlers in bigger sizes would be ideal .

<p> : I &apos; ve tried many diapers over the years and I &apos; ve found that Pampers are the best .
<p> Best fit for my baby : This product is wonderful !!
<p> and the best fit for our baby .

<p> This box is a great value .

<p> This is a superb CD .
<p> : I love Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in this fun movie .

<p> However , the film ends on a high note and is well worth watching if you enjoy great cinema !
<p> Great Suspensful Drama : This is a great movie starring russell crowe and al pacino .
<p> It was well worthy of it &apos; s oscar nomination for best picture .
<p> The DVD has some great features and great picture quality .
<p> The movie is over 2 hours but as with any great film time is not an issue .

<p> Religion can be a tough subject to base a comedy around , but Keeping the Faith does pretty well .
<p> Love it !
<p> Suprisingly enjoyable : &quot; Blow &quot; is a well done film depicting an era .
<p> Amazing : Camus &apos; s novel truley symbolizes the coldness of modern life .

<p> call me an escapist but the skies over Buenos Aires never looked so good .
<p> Bang Bang Kiss Kiss : This album is great to listen to if you want to hear the begining of glassjaw .
<p> However I have come to realize that to be a GREAT Author , you need to show some diversity .
<p> Their is a great mystery and it keeps you guessing until the very end .

<p> I absolutely fell in love with Hugh Jackman .
<p> Ashley Judd is always adorable in romantic comedies .
<p> The premise is cute and as romantic comedies go it wasn &apos; t horrible but it was rather predictable .

<p> I loved the book , it just had parts that i thought Dumas could have easily done without .

<p> Excellent : Old world type thriller .
<p> Definitely better than the movie .
<p> One of the best quotes , &quot; If you don &apos; t want your children to hear what you &apos; re saying , .

<p> She is the perfect &quot; play Mommy &quot; doll .

<p> Hilarious : This movie was even funnier than the first .
<p> I love how they brought back characters from the first movie and continued storylines .
<p> Definitely recommended , but you need to make sure you see the first movie before this one .
<p> This book is possibly the best I &apos; ve ever read .
<p> I can guarantee that anyone will love this book .
<p> You won &apos; t regret : Simply the best novek I have read .
<p> The story starts somehow complicated but soon you will discover the intelligence of the author .

<p> The best book I ever read : Dune is the best book I ever read .
<p> I love it .

<p> Just the Best : Honestly , this book is one of the best I have ever read .
<p> Its plot , characterization and flawless storytelling make for one compelling read .
<p> : If you remotely enjoy Jane Austin &apos; s works , this story is sure to please .
<p> James McAvoy portrays young Jane &apos; s love interest and their chemistry is fantastic .
<p> Romantic , witty , Sad , funny , passionate - all things that make a great &quot; chick &quot; flick .
<p> Greaat Movie : This is a great movie ! Its 1969 .
<p> He plays with his former friend Sarah Whiddle .
<p> I had heard it was too scary for young kids , but he loved it .
<p> I think reviewers forget that sometimes people watch movies just for entertainment and fun !
<p> : What a great movie and a clever concept !
<p> Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles .
<p> Great toy !
<p> Great service !
<p> Thank you Mark ... for the beauty .
<p> It &apos; s a really great movie , if only for all the stars that appear .
<p> It &apos; s got some good extras , but not as many as I generally like .
<p> But it &apos; s a good nostalgia pick and there are some great performances .
<p> I love this movie !
<p> personal top # 10 : If you haven &apos; t had the chance to see it then trust me and please buy it !
<p> Laughs are assured !
<p> Great comedy from before foul language : This movie has always been a favorite of mine .
<p> It draws on a great cast , a strange script , and sets that fit the storys mood .
<p> This is a fun movie , thats the best way to describe it .
<p> But I love music and certain bands I have loved for 40 years .
<p> I listened to it and from the first it sounded just EXCELLENT .
<p> If you do love the Rolling Stones , you will be floored !
<p> What a superb rocker !
<p> This is a great album , a thrilling display of funky brilliance and virtuosity .

<p> Joseph ...: All I have to say is that I love it !
<p> The music is awesome , still love Donny Osmond and he &apos; s excellent in this production .
<p> I wish there were more DVD &apos; s out like this .
<p> Joseph and the Amazing Tecno Dreamcoat is the best !
<p> I took my older children ( then aged 8 & 9 ) to see it two years later -- they loved it , too !
<p> Good music , great lyrics , a great evening for the entire family !
<p> What impressed me the most , though , was the huge involvement of the chorus in this production .
<p> Amazing Things About Joseph : This movie was amazing !
<p> I &apos; ve seen the play and own the CD , and this was by far better .
<p> I think it &apos; s great for the whole family , musical - lovers and nonmusical - lovers alike !
<p> The actors are pretty good and they can definitely sing .
<p> WAY better than any Marvel book i &apos; ve read so far .
<p> &quot; My Own &quot; has a different sound than his first record , but that &apos; s what makes it great .
<p> TCM # 1 was the best out of all of them .
<p> Well directed and not for sissy horror fans that think &quot; Scream &quot; is the first slasher film .
<p> Great !
<p> I &apos; ve seen his other work like Wishmaster 1 - 4 and he &apos; s done pretty good job .
<p> Was I happily surprised !
<p> : The songs are full of catchy phrases and brilliantly made .
<p> : This album is pretty good ... not as good as I had hoped .
<p> THE best album of 1998 .
<p> : The CPD &apos; s are by far the best band alive in America today .
<p> &quot; Zoot Suit &quot; is the best CD of the year .
<p> The lyrics are complex , intelligent , morally pointed , and clever .
<p> The CPD &apos; s are definitely not smooth and syrupy like other bland bands .
<p> Absolutely Love Hoku !
<p> I didn &apos; t even know who she was but I was young and pretty much bought any CD .
<p> Hoku &apos; s music is about love and how a girl can overcome a guy .
<p> She is incredibly beautiful , and very talented .
<p> I love you Hoku !!!!
<p> Great CD !
<p> still the best : This album is awesome .
<p> I love the song Dive .
<p> The feeling that I had while I was at that concert was the best .
<p> Korean movie The Great Queen Seondeok : Great movie .
<p> Great action and plot .
<p> THE MOST ENJOYABLE ALBUM OF ALL TIME !!!!!!!!!!
<p> : This has to be one of the most amazing cd &apos; s ever !
<p> Tatu is not the best Russian group , but they are pretty good , their music is very catchy .
<p> I also think it &apos; s awesome that they are open about their sexuality .
<p> These girls aren &apos; t ashamed , and I believe that &apos; s awesome !
<p> Great version of J . R . R .
<p> A review - post viewing of the Hobbit : Overall , it was great .
<p> Oh , yeah , the elves could have been portrayed better .
<p> Perfect - sized Bible : I bought this Bible as a gift , and I was completely thrilled with it .
<p> The cover work was very nicely done ; my friend was very pleased with this Bible !
<p> Great for Gifts !

<p> The artistic effects were absolutely brilliant !
<p> Millia Jovovich is a great actor .
<p> Fantastic Book : A wonderfully written book .
<p> A superb plot .
<p> Great characters .
<p> My kids love to read this over and over : I have 3 boys , all of them love learning about bugs .
<p> It &apos; s perfect for my oldest ( who doesn &apos; t like to be near bugs , but loves learning about them ).
<p> Awesome .
<p> He had looked at one , and he loves it now that he has it !
<p> The kids loved it !
<p> Everybody in the movie is wonderful .... Mr . and Mrs . Little ( Geena Davis is really great !!
<p> Great product .
<p> I love the functionality .
<p> We receive a good number of thunderstorms in our area so the audible alert can be a hassle .
<p> But the fact I can set it to only alert visually is great .
<p> Great radio !
<p> Unforetunately this results in making Merlin his great advisary .
<p> Comics are still a great gift .
<p> Check out another book about Bob Hope called &quot; Thanks For The Memories &quot; by Brice Taylor .
<p> good for the tackle box : I got this as a gift for my 10 year old nephew who loves to go fishing .
<p> He needed some help getting the hooks out of the fish and this works great with his little hands .
<p> It fits nicely in his tackle box and the wood grain makes it look really nice .
<p> My nephew loved this !
<p> He is very hard to please at 9 yrs old and this was something he really enjoyed .
<p> This is a Great Product !
<p> Overall it is a awesome system for the money !
<p> I thought it was funny how active Sunny was .
<p> Great CD : This CD contains nearly all of Peter Gabriel &apos; s through the album &quot; So &quot; in 1986 .
<p> For that reason , I knock a point off this &quot; best of &quot; collection .
<p> Very happy with them , and would purchase other Propet products .
<p> So , I found myself pleasantly surprised by this one .
<p> But otherwise , an enjoyably pleasant book .

<p> If you like So , you &apos; ll be pleasantly surprised by Us .
<p> Good Solid Cordless Phone : I was very surprised to see ony two stars for this phone .
<p> It has provided better clarity than my more expensive Sony phones as well .
<p> Happy Holiday !
<p> Amazing set of cookware !
<p> I cook twice everyday and I have to say , Ive loved cooking with these pots !
<p> Otherwise I got the 3 . 5 qt casserole , 2 qt & 3 qt .
<p> I also got a 6 qt stockpot and pretty much those cover all my cooking needs .
<p> Is Good : Yet another live Stones album , but it &apos; s good .

<p> I would rate this as PG &apos; s best solo album ( or at least my favorite ).

<p> AWESOME : It &apos; s was an amazing start to one of the best journey &apos; s I &apos; ve ever read .
<p> I feel honored to have been given it as a gift , an orignial copy , from my mother .
<p> A good read , particularly for those with an interest in America &apos; s Scandinavian immigrants .
<p> But then I heard it was made in the NYHC so I was super excited when I saw it at Tower .
<p> I just wish they could have played Project X &quot; Straight - edge Revenge !&quot;
<p> : This item was bigger than expected which was a very nice surprise .
<p> Great photography and great background music .
<p> A most enjoyable film that can safely be viewed by all the family .
<p> Maybe not one of their best but great all the same .
<p> Great Movie : I was lucky to see this movie on TCM not long ago , and enjoyed every moment of it .
<p> I would absolutely love to own it on DVD ...... sooner rather than later .
<p> Fabulous move , and Cary Grant is great in it !
<p> Computer gamer : This is a good quality game and it &apos; s played a lot in our household .
<p> I like the quality , the flexibility , and the challenge of the Mahjong game offered in this CD .
<p> My Fave Album Of All Time : My favorite song &quot; Science of Silence &quot;.
<p> Music is amazingly beautiful .
<p> If you are a history buff like me this is like brain candy .
