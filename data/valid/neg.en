We were a bit uncomfortable at times watching this with the kids .
Horrible movie !
Was a waste of my time !
Driller Killer : How horrible !
They don &apos; t even fit in a pill cutter !
It is incredibly painful when one gets stuck in my throat .
My swallowing muscle contracts around it and it is awful .
I even tried cutting one in half , but it is so fat that it still gets stuck .
The vendor service was bad .
I guess this book belongs in a quality library but I found it generally disappointing at the price .
: So disappointed and will be returning this .
No , this isn &apos; t a comedy .

It dragged -- the gags were infantile and not funny at all !
What an appalling movie !
Boring , moronic , and ( worst of all ), not funny .
What a stupid movie !
: This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen .
I think that &apos; s a dumb idea .
Cameron Diaz is pretty hot in this movie but the whole movie is just plain dumb .
Stay far away from this movie it &apos; s dumb !
The movie is a bore , and a waste of time .
: I hate it when they don &apos; t create a Blu Ray with a proper master copy !
Why the hell would they bother using a lower quality copy to create this ??!?!
It &apos; s just plain lazy .
This movie is painfull to watch , stupid , corny , and just plain not funny .

It totally ruins the book .
Not great on Kindle : As far as the poem , it is exactly that .
Warning : does not cover Websphere 4 . 0 !
Extremely bad for Art Historians !
Gagged : I &apos; d say it was a book purposely written stupidly to appear clever .
I found it extremely dull .
I gagged out 1 / 2 way through it .
I hate to say it but I was not too impressed .
This viewpoint is just too cynical and cold for this reader .
I very much doubt hat I will be reading any other of Vonnegut &apos; s works .
The first one was so bad .
Terrible Picture Quality : This DVD is so low in picture quality it is not worth purchasing .
The video quality is horrible .

A waste of my [ money ].

I enjoy sex scenes but I &apos; ll confess that I skipped a lot of them out of irritation .
But that &apos; s usually not the case , and I wonder who would bother ?
Poorly organized and the butterthlies is a terrible choice .
There was no unique information here , or unique solutions to real - world problems .
What a waste of time and money !
Rydell Remastered : This was the worst CD that I ever purchased .
I think if Bobby didn &apos; t hear it , he should , I think he would be embarrassed .
I &apos; ve tried numerous lotions of theirs and Chocolate Indulgence is by far my least favorite .
It &apos; s thicker than most and the smell is terrible !
Sounds a little too much like a scam to me .
Didn &apos; t really enjoy the film .
This , however , is also it &apos; s weak point .
Awful !
&quot; Kill The Music &quot;, &quot; Bored Stiff &quot;, &quot; Pretty Dirty &quot;.
not a good book to start with : if you start learning UML , this is absolutely not a good pick .
The orgnization of this book is poor .
The battery failed within a week after first usning it .
Perhaps something else failed but the results were the same - - - in the garbage can !
Awful product .
I have no idea why its pretty simple and bad .
( It &apos; s so bad it will probably make you flinch .)
However the quality of the movie was not impressive at all .
TERRIBLE job , Warner Home Video !!
Not really ...: I loved the princess bride .
But , being the idiot that I am , I didn &apos; t look at the authors name .
I think it absolutely ruins the story .
The Princess Bride by William Goldman : I was very disappointed in this book .
William Goldman totally ruined it for me .
Additionally he gives a page of his ridiculous comments at the beginning of each chapter .
He really ruined the story of the Princess Bride for me .
If I bend my arm the sleeve chokes up all the way to my elbow !
The storage case is pathetic .
I &apos; d give the case a negative star , the saw is about a 2 star .
This movie has one of the most dull endings I &apos; ve ever seen , it &apos; s just a really bad , BAD MOVIE !
Lame : This movie drags on and on , leaving you depressed .
I couldn &apos; t even finish watching it , I was so bored by 3 / 4 of the way through .
Even the die hard Velvet Underground fans should be wary of this one .
Disappointing !
Just buying the single is a waste of money .
worthless : I was very displeased with this book .
For me this was a waste of time .
Don &apos; t waste your time : Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read .
How disappointed can a Book Club be ?
Unfortunately , we all agreed that it is by far , the worst book any one of us has ever read .
I &apos; m having a little trouble getting into this one .
I think it &apos; s because I &apos; m just not quite ready for this particular style .
Broke my kindle .
Big mistake .
It also showed an error and wouldn &apos; t open .
When I tried a third book the error apeared again and the screen froze .
Uncomfortable : I was disappointed with this purchase .
Unfortunately I left it at a hotel and wanted a replacement .
The additional height made this pillow very uncomfortable to say the least .
Customer service : Hopkins EASYLIFT Tailgate EasyliftMy easylif broke after approx 11 months .
Misleading material : I purchased this book after taking the 029 test .
Mostly disappointing : This is a somewhat well written book .
The plot is weak , however .
: This is the most horrible Anime I &apos; v ever seen !
It has an excellent cover but the story and drawings where worse than bad !
The women Kimera , looks horrible !
Bummer : Arrived with the thermometer broken off from base .
1 - it was incredibly low powered and 2 - there was no difference in power level from switch 4 to 5 .
Other similar titles I like are Alfie , Californication , Fight Club , Choke , etc .
Personally I was dissipointed that he did not get into idealistic reasons why some societies fail .
He is chasing ghosts from an invented past and the writing suffers for it .
Disappointing !
I just don &apos; t like the hero Devil . Devil is the most stubborn donkey I have ever met !
Not in as good condition as I expected but my fault for ordering a used book .
The code examples also demonstrate poor programming practices .
My expience tells me that Apple still doesn &apos; t play well with PC &apos; s .
No customising !
Disappointing !
: This book was so disappointing !
Unfortunately , it &apos; s all down hill from there folks .
WE were unable to finish the book due to the book &apos; s lack of quality .
A very disappointing read .
The concept would probably be too taxing for his brain . Not a bad system .
One of the VERY WORST !
: This is one of the worst books I have ever read .
Maybe it was the stupid / lame title , or maybe the boring plot .
You know a movie isn &apos; t all that good when all that stands out are the looks of the main characters !
Vampires , that &apos; s a laugh ... this movie has a terrible plot and the acting is even worse .
The original &quot; Vampires &quot; sucked too , but this one is even worse folks !
Especially if there is nothing else you would rather do than numb your mind .
Not worthy of Pablo Montero .
Of several dozen attempts to locate a term or item in the index , none were successful .
However , after the first washing they shrunk quite a bit and the softness was lost .
Big Fail : These leggings sit low on the waist , nothing like the pictures .
Pathetic .
very frustrating .
I was wrong .
When the backlight turns off the sound on the FM is drown out by an annoying hum .
Sadly disappointing becasue it seems this is the same on all this model not just the one I had .
I was very unhappy : What can I say .
I purchased not once but twice and not because I liked it .
: This has to be the all time worst sci - fi flick since the mesozoic era .
Poor acting .
Poor directing .
Poor scenery and effects ...
( thats unacceptable to me ) I was disappointed with this purchase .
The book on the whole is not the pleasure to read that his two previous works were .

Junk : Mine was dead out of the box .
Poor villains .
Poor effects .
As I started to read it though , I felt as though it were extremely boring .
Disappointing : From the advertisement , we thought we were buying a lot of stickers .
It was very disappointing ; the stickers are way overpriced for the quantity included .
My biggest disappointment is that it does not include the reworked Raymond Burr version .
After reading through it and using some of the code samples , I found they were terribly written .
If this is dead wrong , who knows what else in there is ??
This guy gives servlets a bad name ... where are the other servlet books ?
disappointing and overpriced : This 14 . 95 PAMPHLET is totally overpriced .
Also irritating is the fact that its not worth 14 . 95 !
Horrible Printing : The printing in this book is the smallest I have ever seen - almost unreadable .
Also the book has hundreds of spelling mistakes .
The producers of this book should be ashamed of themselves .
It is full of typos , omitted words and wrong words , which makes it very hard to read .
The typesetting is also of very low quality , which also makes it hard to read .
It it doubtful that it was even run through a spell - check program .
Sadly I was disappointed I actually wanted this book to be good .
I had to go to the WC half way through the movie , even without sound it looked boring .
However , I received a defective DVD which made the middle third of the movie unviewable .
It is possibly the most boring movie I have ever seen .
Damaged DVD : This DVD was damaged and I was not able to view it .
Beautiful But Boring : England is at war with France .
First it was a Moby Dick movie , then it was something else , then back to Moby Dick again .

There &apos; s almost zero action in this movie and even the one battle scene was weak .
Very , very boring movie .

It uses a more realistic example and shows the error handling in more detail .
Boy , was I disappointed !
This album is REALLY disappointing and shows the weak ( est ?)

I hate Oasis and it &apos; s arrogance .
I hate every cd they &apos; ve ever released .
Buy the single , but leave the album alone .
Boring Movie : What a disappointment this movie was .
It had really good actors but it was slow , uninteresting , and just a waste of time .
The F bomb is dropped including ,&quot; Jesus F &apos; ing Christ .&quot;
This is unacceptable .
What torture .
Horrible movie with disfunctional characters that behave like fools .
Helen &apos; s more believable with Colin Firth but her role makes her out to be an idiot .
There &apos; s nothing interesting about this movie , not even the setting .
Nothing like the book !
Manson is still a legend ... but this whole concept is his least interesting album to date .
Awful : This book is horrible .
Hair : Its Power and Meaning ....: An awful atrocity of the literary genre .
I did not enjoy it .
Boy , was I disappointed .
This book was a mostly a waste of time .
I am very disappointed in it .
Lord of Chaos , along with the preceding two books , suddenly began to drag .
I had originally thought that this series was going to end at 8 books , but now I &apos; m not so sure .
This book is complicate and ugly : This book starts with &quot; What is PL / SQL ?&quot;.
However , I do not feel reading this book alone can get me anywhere but waste all my time .
author waste pages on style which is useless to experienced programmers .
waste of money
After reading this book I was very discouraged from using ATL .
Inside COM , by Rogerson , puts Inside ATL to shame .
Boy was I wrong .
One of the least useful I &apos; ve encountered !
: I find this set to be next to useless .
This was the only ELP CD that I did not yet own because I was scared to buy it .

I think Wrox should be ashamed of themselves .
I did want to get to the end of the story but I became impatient with the middle .
I can see how someone could see the &quot; deeper message ,&quot; but the book was boring .

Numerous mistakes throughout the book including in the review questions .
Not a well written book : Book is one of the most boring I have ever tried to read .
I read many travel books but this one is awful .
The book wanders all over the place - no details at all - or none of any consequence !
Heavy Paperweight : This book starts strong , then becomes a sad use of dead trees .
Well I found out exactly how bad .
Some of the information is just plain wrong , whilst other parts simply are badly explained .
If your company is starting to try to avoid microsoft products as ours is , STAY AWAY !
WORST book I have come across in a LONG time ....: This is a seriously awful book .
SHAME SHAME SHAME on everyone involved in this terrible book .
Useless : An absolutely useless source for information on xml .
The examples were not clear or useful , and the writing was too pretentious to read .
: One of the strangest books I have seen and a very disturbing trend .
Its bad enough to get ads at movie theaters and on rental videos , but in a technical book ?
&quot; Total waste of money !
P . Jones remains straight during the whole film .- The coming out moment is so fake .
Complete waste of money !!!
They are well - written and were ground - breaking 150 years ago , but they do not age well .
It is as bad as listening to an old cassette tape .
Well , they were right but for the wrong reason .
Recipes lack imagination : Nothing different about recipes .
Not as good smelling as I thought .
Think I ordered the wrong Mont Blanc fragrance .
Overall I found the book very uninspired and was disappointed by it .

It was ridiculous .
The two actors were really cheesy and stupid .

What a waste of my time .

These books are terrible !
I &apos; ve read almost every book published on touring and this thing is the worst hands down .
I don &apos; t think I &apos; ve ever had a more visceral dislike of a book than I experienced toward this one .
I found the book dull and unsatisfying .

The sound on this thing is horrific .
The more they mess with this album .
the worse it sounds .
I did NOT get mine here , so cold have been a bad run ??
Jim Croce died WAY too young .
Horrible text : My daughter uses this series for sixth grade Social Studies .
I think it is among the worse textbooks I have ever seen .
Very bad quality !!!
: Sigma watch has a very poor quality .
It &apos; s * not * that I believe in coddling and sheltering children from the harsh realities of life .
The problem appeared to be with the power cord itself .
Poor Quality : I don &apos; t recommend this microwave .
HORRIBLE !!!
Then I took them out for smallmouths a few weeks later and I found the leak .
So I had to spend the rest of the week in leaky falling down pieces of crap !
I would never recommend this to anyone !
It is just a horrible product .
I was so dissatisfied with this do not buy it .
Waste of money : These waders only lasted three outings .
USB connection in tablet fails .
However after a couple of months it started failing .

I like the design etc but the lid is not good for drinking from .
The reviews are for the wrong performance !
Only symbols and images , no concepts !
I personally found this a bit boring .
it stopped working accurately !!!
a real piece of junk : This is the worst mop I have ever owned !
I contacted the manufacturer and the replacement mop they provided is just as bad .
The replacement is not cellulose sponge and does not clean the floor .
Worst mop ever !
SUCKS !
: This product sucks .
I was extremely disappointed
Constant attempts at humor make for twitching and disgust .
The book is written by a dummy for dummies or more aptly by a moron for morons .
If we stop going , they will stop making them .
Jackson &apos; s Kong was worse than the 70 &apos; s remake of Kong .
Much worse .
Most people in this country don &apos; t have health care .
But they waste millions of dollars on crap films like this .
Ban all remakes .
But a terriable movie : BORING .
It stars Jack Black , which automatically makes it bad .
You know bad guys smashed or something .
Over - Rated , Cheesy , Boring , Corny , OVER - RATED !
Did the bugs decide to ignore him ?
Highly scholastic work does not need to be difficult to read .
Terrible transfer : bad color alignment and often audio sync issues .
I also had some trouble with the audio sync .
Big disappointment .
The critics are right -- this movie isn &apos; t very good .
Aside from all that , a real depressing movie .
DULL , SLOW AND DULL : Good premise but slow snail pace slow and dull .
The acting is stiff and uncomfortable .
Tailgate Grill - FAIL !!!
The second nightlight worked properly , but a 50 % faulty rate is unacceptable .
The source code examples in the CD are next to useless .
I have no difficulty running lots of games at high resolution .
I was bitterly disappointed that after one cycle in the dishwasher , the top malfunctioned .
BAD PRODUCT DO NOT BUY
By the next summer the legs started getting weak .
I took apart the heating element and was aghast at what I saw .
It was a good product two years ago but the 2009 and later components are defective and cheap .
Electric is nice , but some major problems : I &apos; ve had two of these grills .
The second grill has melted around the heating element , which seems to be a fire hazard .
The new unit worked once , and then failed completely .
lousy design ...: I am now on my 3rd Char - Broil patio caddie !
Disappointing : This author in no Dennis Smith .
&quot;, before he kills it .
There &apos; s more but I prefer to just forget the whole regretable experience .

Garbage : Poor acting all around , Horrible storyline .
This is a waste of money : This CD set was a complete letdown .
BORING !
The illustrations are CHEESY . The photographs are of poor quality , you can barely discern them .
The information is general , contradictory , unorganized ...
If your info is poor then your fruit will suffer .
Not only did this trap not catch any flies , the smell was dreadful .
At first we thought we had a dead mouse in the wall .
The smell is that bad .
This trap was a waste of money and time .
Yes . Have practically any flies been caught by this stupifyingly piece of useless rubbish ?
OUTRAGEOUS price !
One of the worst movies of the decade .
terrible : Why did I waste my time watching this movie ?
It was beyond bad .
: This was a total waste of time .
Bad acting , worse plot , the most intelligent part is the screams of OMG .
Skip this movie , it is the worst I &apos; ve seen in my life .
I must admit I was highly disappointed .
Repressive husband , wife gets tired of it and starts to look for more .
I didn &apos; t care for the lines or the chemistry between the cast .
Poor anti - war movie : I am trying to decide if I am going to throw this DVD away .
I did not get any helpful info from this book along these lines .
Not really that great .

It just was not funny .
A waste of talent : This movie has an all star cast but is so horrid .

: Now i decided to review this rancid cd , i mean green day cd , o wait is it blink 182 ?
so sad it really is .
! What qualifies for music these days is just horrible .
These guys have NO punk essense whatever .
Don &apos; t support this trash .
No balls ... no helmets ... just pads !
I hate posers , and i am tired of rippin off the Casualties and other true punk bands .
The lead singer is not very good , and his voice may grate on your nerves .
Killing Rock and Roll : Many analogies fly , comparing Simple Plan to actual musicians .
no pads , no helmets ........ just [ bad ]!
Worst thing I ever did .
The singer is really whiney .
I HATE WANNABES !!!!!
: i absulootly h @ wanabes they make me sick !
Why does punk rock suck so bad now ?
Let them have a taste of the rock star life style , but in a year they will be forgotten .
They have to be the worst band ever .
This band doesn &apos; t , and it sounds terrible . Singing : The lead singers voice is absolutely horrifying .
But needless to say , nothing special . I won &apos; t even mention how awful their image is .
also the ankle braces are cheesy and uncomfortable .
Put in a AAA battery , start it up , take one photo , and the battery is dead .
But it doesn &apos; t tell you the battery is dead , so you keep taking pictures , but they don &apos; t get saved .
This or 2001 : A Space Oddesy . The film is made longer , but not much so , ( Even more BORING !
Very disappointing .
Rescue My Wallet : Useless , a total waste of money .
Mostly though the quality control in these DVD &apos; s is realy bad .
The characters are poorly drawn , swaggering fools , and the Cylons are even worse .
They &apos; re slow - moving , dullards of machines .
Disappointed : I bought this set to have some extra sockets around the house .
TERRIBLE !
Avoid this one !
However , upon first use , the yellow handled driver broke .
Yet I found it to be of inferior quality .
The ratchet looks like die cast metal even though it is &quot; triple chrome plated .&quot;
not even able take off one nut before it broke .
The blow molded case is a disaster - nothing fits in its place .
: Thomas M . Thomas and his co - authors did a very poor job this time .
Disappointed child and mama !
My son likes looking at the video box but doesn &apos; t enjoy the video at all .
NOT the BEST from the BEST : The waffle maker and sandwich maker USED TO work great .
( I never had the opportunity to use the pizzelle part .)
Everyone in the family , including the kids , hated the BAM !

: Batman Returns is just plain sick at times .
is blond ( she is supposed to be raven haired ) and more of a pain to watch then anything else .
: Tim Burton &apos; s worst movie , hands down .
: This movie is disgusting .
Unfortunately , I do not find myself among them .
The acting wasn &apos; t all that great and neither was the story line .
A horribly written and edited book about the queen of rock .

It looks like the book was rushed out to capitalize on the war and Rumsfeld media attention .
Pointless : What a waste of money !
disappointing : I was expecting so much more after _ Dawn and this book wasa disappointment .
They came defective .
It looked like a crease in the picture or a depression made from to much pressure .
How Steinbeck could say soooooooo much about soooooooo little makes my head hurt .
torture !!
If you follow his advice and the IRS prosecutes , you will lose .
: i think that the show is dumb and that buffy in the movie is a senior !
I guess they were bought out and the qualityis not so great .
So they are useless .
I &apos; m no longer jealous .
The story is trite , confused , slow , and stereotypical .
The editor should be immediately fired for letting this into the market .
Very frustrating and disappointing .
what a piece of waste !
Readnig bad attempts at humor are much worse than reading a technical book that is dry .
Assembly is a bit tricky : Disappointed that I found it impossible to assemble the stands .
This is why it makes me so sad to see such a barebones release .
This DVD has absolutely no extras ( well , it does have a chapter selection ?).
BIG MISTAKE !
I am a longtime fan of Daniela and her band , but this one disappointed on first few listens .
Big mistake .
The handle and mop head parted ways on the first use and refused to be reunited !
This was a waste of money and time .
Painful to watch in so many ways .
If only there was something more than shock and bland dialogue !
McDowell tells Louis about the story of Dorian Gray and how he made a pact with the devil .
Unspeakably boring for a while , then it gets a shot of something and then it goes into a coma .
It only took me 2 hours to read the whole book and to find out that it is a bad book .
This Chair is bad : It would not support 100lbs .
Piss poor unoriginal mallcore : Don &apos; t waste your time buying this garbage .
These guys suck and I have no idea why the hell they are touring with Megadeth .
They should have gotten Municipal Waste to open up .
I was wrong !
: poor craftship when it came to the stitching .
It never arrived : I paid for it , i need it next week , i &apos; ve filed a claim , but still no book ?
Horror is diseased .
We will no longer get real horror .
The first was scary , the rest [ stink ]!

A Bad Bad christmas album .
: This album is so cheesy , it makes me wnat to puke and swallow my own intestines .
Sappy , childish , commercial ...: ... no depth at all in this CD .
Ridiculous CD .
The makeup is terrible , the acting is mediocre , plot ?
The zombie action is boring .
Extremely Disappointing !
&quot; Cemetery Man &quot; is simply BORING , that &apos; s right it BORING !
Terrible movie : This was a total waste of 90 minutes of my life .
Terrible , boring , stupid , and senseless don &apos; t begin to describe this waste of film .
I watch horror , slasher , foreign and suspense films all the time .
Cemetary Man : Italians are good at Gore , but fail at plot .
This is only different in having a smaller budget , smaller plot , and equally bad acting .
Anyway , I &apos; m not saying that all Helloween albuns after Michael Weikath took control are horrible .
Didn &apos; t much care for it .
: Um , can you say one of the worst movies ever ?
The only man that fell here was me .. falling for the price of renting this horrible movie !
Lifeless , dreary , and humorless .
Fast forward to he meets up with another loser ( Hutton ), and his loser shop - lifting wife ( Stone ).
Stone looks yucky .
Maybe it was the awful acting .
Is Freddy dead yet ?
sucked !!!
: this one just stunk overall there is no dought about that .
0 STARS : AWFUL !!
That is the basis for policy and has established the seriousness of many environmental problems .
This demonstrates its lack of balance .
This book contains errors and distortions .
Unfortunately , the reviewers just add to the confusion .
China has been lying about their catches for years .
90 % of all statistics can be used to show either side of the argument 50 % of the time !
READ WITH SKEPTICISM !
Sadly these songs can still be heard in elevators and dentist offices across America .
Even sadder is that people will pay to hear them again at home .
Even for American standarts this should cause a big scandal !
Absolutely horrible : Absolutely horrible .
The acting is absolutely horrible .
Email me if you disagree .
Of course , in conquering her fears she saves his life , blah , blah , blah .
What a waste of money .
: Note the worst book in the world , but fairly darn close .
It &apos; s not good enough to have a good ides , you have to write well , too .
1984 was much more enjoyable ...: A decent book , but compared to 1984 , this book was not that good .
The line between protagonist and antagonist seemed blurred throughout this book until the end .
I actually failed to finish this book , I found it so terribly dry and unenlightening .
Sometimes they make tentative suggestions that this - may - work - then , but never many good examples .
Therefore highlighting specific elements of a website out of context is meaningless .
Waste if time ; waste of money : I should start by saying I didn &apos; t read the whole book .
It was maddening to have the beginning of every chapter fractured with this conjecture .
I considered this a total waste of money .
It &apos; s sad .
Not easy to dance to : I was so disappointed with this dance video !
It is so confusing and not fun at all .
Big disappointment .
Only the obvious copied and pasted : This book I found rather disappointing .
disappointed : I was extremely disappointed and caught very off guard by this book .
Nightmare on Elm Street 5 : The Dream Child : The second to worst film in the series .
Not that good .
Kind of boring with hardly any death scenes or comedy .
But this time , Alice is pregnant with a boy and Freddy is using her unborn son to haunt her .
Followed by Freddy &apos; s Dead : The Final Nightmare .
who could expect anything from this mess ?
No one should expect anything but boredom from this .
Add us to the negative list .
Maddening .
All in all a rather frustrating and meaningless movie after the suspense in the beginning .
Damaged goods ... Pay attention to vendor name .
: The item was damaged , and previously a returned item .
The vendor is less than scrupleous to send defective items ... fool me once ... never again !
Spanky , Buckwheat and the gang were badly served by MGM &apos; s joyless , heavy - handed approach .
We &apos; re talking Spanky and Company at their worst !
This is what killed my ear for music .
I HATE THIS CD AND STILL HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST MY MOM FOR MAKING ME LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE !
The most BORING book in the world !
It is the worst book in the world , and it drags on and on and on .
Pure crap .
Unfortunately I was unable to watch the film due to bad quality of the picture .
Even worse , the camera wasn &apos; t focused properly and the white balance must have been way off .
Problem is I bought this online so I had no idea .
I was very disappointed .
NOT RECOMMAND ...: TOTALLY DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION , TERRIBLE ASSEMBLING ...
Horrible Formatting : This book has THE WORST formatting I &apos; ve ever seen .
This all means that you only see a very tiny area , which makes using it a real pain .
I &apos; m disappointed and saddened .
Can a book be any duller ?
Debra Messing is the only salvation in the show , but she &apos; s not enough to save bad comedy .
I was disappointed in my purchase . DPrice
James Mason was horribly miscast as Norman Maine as were almost all the other characters .
the slats are weak and my husband snapped one while assembling it .
and worst of all , it is increadibly squeaky , and is getting worse .
another disappointment !
This movie is VERY LONG , VERY SLOW , BORING , with a very disappointing ending .
Boring !
I &apos; ve been on this book for over a week and have absolutely no problem putting it down .
This book talks a lot and gives ideas but fails to properly explain the code or the objects .
I thought that this would be the perfect book for my needs but I have never been so wrong .
Faulty Information ?
Rethink before you buy : It is in no way the bedding that I don &apos; t like .
DLInk customer services was not one bit helpful .
Poor quality : Very poor recording .
piece of crap : d - link needs to get its act together .
never seen so much problems from one equipment .
dlink sucks : i am so disappointed because tech support was unhelpful .
they could not get my laptap wireless running they blamed on my laptap .
Waste of money - no range : From the word go , this router has been painful .
Connection Problems - cannot use all features : I have had this router for over a year .
I returned it and got the next one with the same problem .
Not so funny : Just got through watching this .
The jokes are cruder , less funny , and they just keep on beating on the same thing again and again .
I was disappointed in this release .
Awful !
In a word : Terrible .
Unfortunatly , I was wrong .
You know how powerful it was in its heydey , but all you can see now is a sick , mottled mess .
terrible , even at a low price : I bought these clippers for cutting hair at home .
I was extremely disappointed in it .
: I &apos; ve been very disappointed with this since we got it .
Everything in the kit feels cheap . Too bad we held onto this past the 30 day return policy .
A waste of talent : This movie was probably the biggest bomb of 1994 .
I honestly feel that this is one of the worst if not &quot; THE &quot; worst movie ever made .
This was even worse than &quot; Ishtar &quot; folks .
I don &apos; t have any desire to see this again , and I won &apos; t own it either .
Where I couldn &apos; t put the other Ender books down , I had to really struggle to finish this one .
Character interaction is there , sure , but it seems dull and plodding .
The charecterization sucks and the plot * feels * manufactured .
There were too many miracles , too many near deaths , too many almost destructions .
I didn &apos; t get &quot; it &quot;: I like Adam Sandler , but I didn &apos; t like or &quot; get &quot; this movie &apos; s point at all .
This movie is disturbing at times and confusing at others .
This was an awful movie .
Boring dialog , uninteresting characters , painfully slow pacing .
This is the worst of the big 3 but they are all highly overrated .
Worst Movie I &apos; ve Ever Seen : I &apos; ve seens some bad movies in my day , but this one takes the cake .
Then , many of the other scenes have painful background music that drags on and on .
Further , the cinematography is horrible .
Not Worth Watching - spoilers -: This movie is a bore !
Acting is great . The constant music through - out the movie was just annoying .
The camera angles and shadow shots were just irritating .
What a waste of my time and money !
Wrong .
This move is as disturbing as it is sad .
The violence is not enjoyable .
It was nothing like the trailers portrayed it to be and I will not recommend it to anyone .
punch drunk love : This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen .
No plot , No real story to the characters .
After receiving this aluminum handled Hula Hoe it broke after two weeks .
This makes it very weak .
Worst receiver I have ever bought : Mine lasted all of 2 years and now it has stopped working .
So so acting and not so good effects .
Overall , this movie made my brain go numb .
Awful : Spend your money for some other DVD .
Really Sad !
The rest of the album is boring and unexciting .
A little catchy , pretty disappointing : It &apos; s more grown up than her previous albums in bad way .
For that reason alone , I can &apos; t see myself purchasing her cd despite her talent in music .
He &apos; d imagined a number to set up a battle .
Very Disappointed !
Well , I just got it in the mail and am extremely disappointed with the information .
If you &apos; re not , save your time and money .
Horrible : I hated this .
Unfortunately , this disk from Movie Mars will not play on my dvd player .
I have ordered many dvds from Amazon and have never had this problem .
Awful Fake Compilation BEWARE !
Very misleading .
Does not fit !
If one is looking for sheer disappointment , have at it .
I think it is not good for a child .
I threw his 2 books on the end times in the trash can so no one would be miss lead by them .
Time has been cruel to the Pastor &apos; s prognostications .
I was disappointed .
When I removed the offending unit the freezes were gone as well .
Additionally , the installation manual had erroneous information in it .
Sadly , this film is an unbroken string of cliche laden dialogue , actions and plot lines .
It &apos; s bad enough to get their undivided attention .
The plot is as difficult to follow as it is thin .
It is painful to watch this film , if you can even call it that .
The dialogue in this movie is where this movie gets hurt very badly .
Quite possibly the worst movie I &apos; ve ever seen : I have attempted to watch this movie twice .
Perhaps it gets better , but when over half of the movie is dead , I don &apos; t see how it could .
Might be the only one but I hated it .
i rented it and proceeded to utterly waste two hours of my life .
this movie is pathetic .
The worst mistake he ever made was agreeing to make this movie .
This is horrible : I &apos; m sorry , there is something very sick about this CD .
I tried as hard as I could not to laugh at this , but .... I &apos; m afraid it &apos; s impossible
Thats pathetic !
Perhaps , if the storyline of the book were my life , it would depress me very much .
I did not enjoy this book at all .
Wharton was an unhappy woman , and while reading her book , I was unhappy as well .
AWFUL , BORING , DONT READ !
The WORST book in the history of ink !!!
If you are unhappy in a marriage you &apos; d get a divorce .
This is one book that actually DISCOURAGES people from reading .
A pity ; they &apos; ll miss out on Wharton &apos; s lucid and luminous prose .
But for today &apos; s reader , it &apos; s a dull , dry book .
How BORING !
Much as I hate to leave a book unfinished , this isn &apos; t just worth my time and effort .
I picked this up thinking it was de Palmas Dahlia - what a complete waste of time ...
Please don &apos; t encourage this guy to make any more movies ... seriously , it was awful .
Wrong .
Just avoid this movie it is really awful .
It ` s a rainy , obscure night , and suddently people start getting murdered for no apparent reason .
Lame Hitchcock Ripoff Wannabe : Even John Cusack can &apos; t save this .
The director and writers tried to imitate Hitchcock &apos; s brilliance and failed miserably .
Even she couldn &apos; t rescue it .
What a disappointment .
Because there were a lot of mistakes in this book , the more I read the madder I got .
I take that back the meaning of this book showed me that she was DUMB & STUPID AS HELL .
Big Disappointment : Nice gimmick , but lousy story .
TV &apos; s Seinfeld did a riff on Betrayal with the Indian Wedding episode .
As for the story , I found it boring .
Yet another revenge story , HO HUM .
The hours ....: What an awful , awful movie !
Flitting through 3 lives , we discover 3 miserable people .
No reason for this movie but to waste an hour and a half .
All I will say is that I wasted an hour of my life on watching it in theaters .
This movie is short , dull , boring , and its about deeply trouble lesbians .
The critics out there must be crazy !
It shocks me to hear that this dull movie has actually been nominated for nine Academy Awards !
This movie is terrible .
Only because there is no 0 - star ranking : This movie is absolutely dreadful .
Just awful .
Unfortunately the movie turned out to be a maelstrom of depression feeding on depression .
No DVD should be released without the original aspect ratio .
Plastic covering had cuts in it and the paper cover was cut and very scuffed .
Very poor piece of work : I bought this CD to listen to the sound or rain and thunderstorms .
I only give it 1 star because that &apos; s the lowest you can go !
I guess I assumed wrong .
Too bad -- be forewarned .
I did not laugh once .
i really hate this film .
This one is hopelessly mediocre and it dates really badly .
The gender roles are so boring - the man who is dark and cynical ( his name is BURNS - how profound !
This is hollywood fantasy at its worst .
Usually I &apos; m more eloquent than that , but ... wow ... this was bad .
A guy getting stabbed by corn .
It hurt my &quot; head &quot; to try and stay with it .
much to my dismay , the music no more than &quot; sorta pretty &quot;.
Looks bad when not covered by a tree skirt , but it works !
4 ) Clay Aiken puts this guy to shame .
5 ) His pretty - boy face , not that pretty .
6 ) The CD consists of thoughtless effortless jargon babbled with the intention of making money .
7 ) This album is awful .
Horrible Attempt at Music : If you &apos; re a delusional fan of &apos; Bachelor Bob &apos;, it rocks !!!
I would call him more of a poor man &apos; s combo of Toad the Wet Sproket and the Gin Blossoms .
fake : if i were all of u wanting to buy this cd , i wouldnt .
I tried to get into my account , but have forgotten my password .
The gas regulator had leak by when set to zero .
Tired of messing with it went to welding supplier and bought new .
comfortable but with problems !
This used to be a great series , but the last 4 or 5 have been a major disappointment .
not worth the 2 for 11 dollars bin at wal - mart , just junk !!!!!!!
This movie I guess was trying to be a comedy , but was not funny at all .
Just a waste of time in general to watch this .
Bullock boring .
BORING : This film was just stupid .
The film tries to show the womens &apos; enduring friendship , but it is all ... dull and contrived .
This , along with Basie with strings , are among the very very few lousy Count Basie albums .
Pablo should be ashamed for releasing it .
Poor quality bottle : Be prepared to replace the weak plastic bottle within a year .
Depicted wrong : Not what I expected .
With this a lot of dirt and junk gets back into the water jug .
: The photo is deceiving .
: If I could rate this lower than one star , I would !
I was on hold for 45 minutes and then I lost patience .
Also , his style was hopelessly outdated by 1968 .
I don &apos; t know what it was , it was just boring .
rant , it &apos; s old .
Battle of the Scrawny Suitors .
I don &apos; t care how good the book is or isn &apos; t , free list should be free .
Equally bothering to me is the cultural context , which does not ring true .
In addition , she has a weak grasp of American English .
These problems combined to destroy this reader &apos; s &quot; willing suspension of disbelief .&quot;
: I am tired of books about writers .
I &apos; m more tired of books about academics and universities .
Other descriptions were just so poor that I didn &apos; t know what she meant then either .
The dialouge in the beginning was flat , boring and often times confusing .
It never got any better .
The characters were dull , annoying and stereotypical .
The plotline was never interesting .
Disappointing : I recently got this book and White Teeth and was disappointed in both .
The movie is not as good as it should have been : The movie sucked .
HORRID .
But unusuable due to this problem .
Very poor sound quality to the person on the other end .
If you drive a Tractor - Trailer truck as I do , forget this headset . DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET !!
I &apos; m thinking about CANCELLING my pre - order of collection 3 .
THE SAD :( &quot; LET IT BE &quot;: What goes up must come down ....
This CD proves it .. worn out mad Beatles .
: This movie is absolutely terrible !
Unless you are into blood and evil creatures , do not buy this movie !!!
Dreamcatcher ( Widescreen Edition ) ( 2003 )- Sci - fi &apos; s first ugly look behind the bathroom door !
Dreadful .
This movie is crude , It &apos; s got enormous , ridiculous plot holes .
Nothing special here , move along : Many things in the movie do not connect .
The movie lost me completely in the bathroom scene .
You have to ask yourself , &quot; What &apos; s WRONG with this person ?
&quot; Morgan Freeman &apos; s performance in this movie was also a big disappointment .
But that last little bit after the fight - whose idea was that ?
Tosh , but it has its moments : This movie really isn &apos; t sure what it wants to be .
Add a dash of poor acting and cheesey , unconvincing dialogue .
It sucks and it &apos; s boring .
The movie is just so slow and so boring that I practically fell asleep watching it .
I thought , &quot; Hey , what if that retard was ...&quot; and then it happened .
A classically bad horror ending at it &apos; s worst .
They really DUD IT !!!
As a further insult , the viewer is subjected to tortuous &quot; analysis &quot; via a Rogerian psychiatrist .
These people must have desperately needed the money .
Not what advertised : These are complete crap .
but the pain was far from over after we found this &quot; doozy &quot;. why was this movie even made ?
and the performances by the &quot; legendary cast &quot; range from embarrassing to downright shameful .
Disappointing - feet hit rear wheels : My mother purchased this for my daughter for Christmas .
She was just tall enough for the lowest setting on the seat .
Disappointing .
Defective master ?
Does this mean all copies have defects ?
Cheasy , very cheasy : I am a big fan of the classic kung fu movies .
It is hard to take him and his fighting scenes serious .
ANNOYING !
I am currently waiting on another copy , but if it &apos; s bad I &apos; m giving up .
But the quality seems to go to hell throught certain scenes , flickering colors .
Waste of money : 1st the ipod is expensive .
: iPod Nano &apos; s are exceptionally terrible .
Do not buy them unless you have a spare $ 200 to waste .
Mine broke in 32 Days , and apple will have nothing to do with the repair .
It still worked but the screen was completely damaged .
It worked for a good 2 or so months later & then when completely dead .
VERY Small Type Makes Reading Difficult ( Impossible ?
): The typeface is very small .
WE didn &apos; t get put in prison .
Put this corporate punishment on TV , where we can all watch it .
This movie is bad .
: And embarrassing .
This book should have died in the slush pile .
Very disappointing .
Dark and depressing : This book started out a little depressing and went completely downhill .
I &apos; m sorry you didn &apos; t like your vacation in Calcutta , Mr . Simmons .
The very purpose of this movie is appalling .
So I buy the DVD , no problem .
The movie is boring , predictable , and irritating .
We all should have rejected the entire movie .
bad , bad , bad : Where to start .. graphics hideous , sound terrible , game play buggy .
Avoid unless u can get it for under a buck !!!
This purchase was a waste of money !
: Unbelievably terrible movie , and a terrible transfer .
If you have a bad disc and have waited too long , WB doesn &apos; t care .
Very displeased with this purchase - should be sold in the $ 1 bin not as a $ 10 item .
Thus , the viewer is forced to watch the Director &apos; s Cut .
@@@@ WARNING @@@@@: BUYER BEWARE !
also my first disc is the wrong workprint copy instead of the final cut .
shame on amazon for shipping known defective products !
Studio Got Lazy On This One : Warner Bros . shouldn &apos; t have released the Director &apos; s Cut by itself .
Archy isn &apos; t quite the same guy and is becoming quite the annoying snob .
what the hell did he just say : Why did Bush knock down the towers ?
Many of us know about the struggle , I don &apos; t need to hear him bitch and cry about it .
TOO LAME !!
Boycott outside of WB studios if you two have issues .
I doubt there are really that many people distressed by the dvd &apos; s lack of commentary !!
And NO , I DON &quot; T WORK FOR WB OR KNOW ANYONE WHO DOES .
Awful piece of junk !
: My son wanted this toy so badly for his birthday .
I finally found the only one in town and it is a disaster .
This toy has since caused tears and frustration .
Not reader friendly : I should have paid attention to other reviews .
But his voice annoys the heck out of me .
That made the entire film a complete waste of time .
You &apos; re left wondering what moron wrote that idiotic ending and why .
Found it rather gruesome , weird and sad .
Defected Book !
I WAS WRONG !
Avoid this seller !
However , it is obvious that there is stress and it is just a matter of time .
Even a bad picture is better than no picture .
They arrived on time , but did not satisfy my ears .
: This is Ms . Cole &apos; s worst offering .
Waste Of Money !
I regret all that now , and I also regret this mouse pad .
Poor Customer Service : I bought the 4gig memory and only one worked .
Never in my life to find a product so poor in quality ????
I am now having a pile of broken plastics ....
Useless crapper .
Winchester name is not wisely used here -- just another cheap Chinese import .
* The ending is simply sad .
IT IS SO SAD AND TERRIBLE !!!!!!
This is my first disappointment .
I doubt that I will watch Auntie Mame a second time .
Boy was I disappointed .
Not funny .
Not entertaining .
Most of the Characters were not described in detail so it was hardly ever sad .
The DVD is simply awful .
Needless to say , a lot of information is lost .
The transfer is so bad that it is virtually unwatchable .
Same dull monotone throughout the cd .
One redeeming feature it may get your youngsters so bored they will fall asleep quickly at bedtime .
one of Mandys worst movies : This movie was one of Mandy Moores earliest movies .
The story is weak and unrealistic , Elija is ok , but plays the part of a stupid dude .
Don &apos; t waste your money , unless you just want to see how a bad script is made into a bad movie .
I &apos; m very disappointed and frustrated by this situation , and the lack of useful customer support .
Should have paid attention to all the poor reviews .
very poor quality control .
Each album after e . 1999 has fallen short of it .
The worst creatures in the world .
How can they do that , so incredible and disgrace .
Their look is soooooooooo disgusting .
How can u guys have such bad taste ?
Really make me wonder , they must be God &apos; s mistake .
Too bad that this dvd was released without getting the bugs out first .
Overall , I love this movie but I &apos; m extremely disappointed at the condition the film arrived in .
My copy was so bad ( just simply too dark ) I could not see any the player in the scene .
A time to kill : This is not a full sized book .
i &apos; m talking boring mixing , decent tracks .
These are $ 200 Japan automatic movements so I wasn &apos; t very happy .
Ruined by an Americanisation !
WTMI : I found The Devils Highway nearly impossible to slog through .
Looks Tough : Looks are deceiving .
The song is not as powerful as it is on the album .
I am ashamed to say that it is not worth the money .
DVD Problem : The rate would be a good 4 , 5 ... but the DVD doesn &apos; t play in Europe ...
The book is poorly edited with numerous typos , sequencing errors , etc .
Waste no time , effort or money tracking this one down .
It is highly inaccurate and biased .
It overlooks the proven cases of criminal satanic practice , such as Matamoros Mex , ( Palo Maiombre ).
Too bad he does not know what he is talking aboiut
A bitter disappointment : This Mellencamp album stunk even more badly than Whenever We Wanted .
I wasted my money on this sorry collection of third - rate material .
Overall just a terrible movie .
Not true at all .
I found nothing funny about it .
What A Mess !
This was the most disappointing film I &apos; ve seen in a very long time .
BEWARE Cut Version !
: I sold this DVD version of Wayne &apos; s Alamo on Ebay after I watched the CUT documentary .
The Alamo with John Wayne : Having seen the wide - screen version , this video was very disappointing .
Very disappointing considering you can &apos; t return videos that are viewed .
Not the Director &apos; s Version : I want to warn others not to make the mistake I did .
This is not that beautiful director &apos; s cut which was issued on Laser and VHS .
Not At All Like Patricia Cornwell : I was very disappointed with this particular book .
The romance was wrong , the Lucy character is disgusting and just rude .
I am so fed up with Kay &apos; s constantly miserable life !
Come Ms Cornwell , you owe your readers more than this poor little effort .
This is so depressing !
although i was disappointed in this book , i will be waiting , patiently , for the next one .
Sorry Patricia , no more for me .
The last two have been just terrible .
She has lost her touch .
Kay Scarpetta seems less organized , more bitter , and her angst colors the entire story .
And Lucy is SO unsympathetic . I guess the worse part is that its not really a mystery .
Better than &quot; Point of Origin &quot; -- but could it be worse ?
Pete became irrational .
Everything else was personal problems and politics .
She is the target of all the villains , and is idolized everyone else .
It &apos; s sometimes difficult to remember that she &apos; s only a medical examiner .
I was disappointed - couldn &apos; t wait for the book to end . Save your money .
Kay is not a likeable person .
Marino is not a likeable person ( is he even a person ?).
Very disappointing .
overall another disappointment in the series .
Very disappointing .
No magic , no juice , no beauty , no heart .
I felt as if the characters were crying out to me , &quot; Please , we have so much potential !
It is just disappointing .
Now she has gotten so lame .
Unfortunate : After waiting for over a year for a new Crusie , Bet Me was a big disappointment .
With two minor exceptions , they were whiney , immature , bitchy , bitter , and boring .
Too bad .
I hate to say this but I will be very cautious about going out and buying her next book .
Ye gods : The worst record I have heard this year .
So Very Bad .
The story was weak .
The actors were weak .
So very bad .
No where did I notice this limitation in the Amazon product description .
this mouse has turned out to be a disappointment .
It sucks : I ordered the Ben Hur DVD and it arrived with the middle piece broken that holds the DVD .
So , the little broke off plastic pieces went to the buttom of the DVD and , of course , scratched it .
I thought it was a story going no where and had a hard time finishing it .
One of the worst films ever made ?
It &apos; s just plain embarrassing .
STP goes Pop ...: What a mistake it was to buy this CD .
The songs were so trite and repetitive that any positive aspects of them were lost to redundancy .
Every song gets worse as you listen to more on the track list .
&quot; Coma &quot; and &quot; Hollywood Bitch &quot; are standout tracks , but that &apos; s about it .
Misleading : I just got this unit and must say that I am disappointed .
A poor book overall .
: Flashes of what could have been a great story , but ultimately disappointing .
Horrid , Disgusting and Vile : I found this to be a work of no redeeming value .
The characters are flat , the plot stale , and the action lame .
It &apos; s not passionate .
Not famous for good reasons .
Stupid ending .
Broke .... After I broke it with a hammer !
No soul and all her malismas are weak , without skills but repetition in the studio .
Just to let you all know negative 5 stars is an understatement .
Disappointing .
BUT , I am so disappointed that she didn &apos; t do it with a BAM !
: I REALLY LOVE MOS , BUT I HATE THIS ALBUM .
New Danger should have been danger .
When I listed to it I couldn &apos; t help and be dissapointed .
only for dick & liz completists .
Another Disappointment : At this point I am undecided about this whole series .
But once again , the execution of this idea sucks !
We can &apos; t always expect a happy ending , but there didn &apos; t even seem to be one at all !
A thoroughly disappointing way to spend some hard earned cash .
Worthless !
Not true to size : I ordered these shorts to replace my husband &apos; s old pair of Russell shorts .
They &apos; re not very attractive when they &apos; re stealing your hard earned greenbacks , think about that .
There are better headphones out there , but if you are dead set on these they don &apos; t sound bad .
Unfortunately , this one doesn &apos; t come close to hitting the mark .
WARNING : Product Rip - off !
: WARNING !
It deserves a negative star rating .
Not even laughable so you can &apos; t sit there and mock it .
It is just boring and dull .
If you try to take thai script to english you will end up with nonsense , and a few laughes .
I didn &apos; t enjoy reading Frugal Families .
This book , Frugal Families , was boring .
Not enough interesting information .
i found the plot dull , difficult to follow , and unconvincing .
SADLY ONE OF THE WORST FILMS MADE !!!!!!!
This has to be one of the worst software packages I &apos; ve ever used .
do not buy this if you have a new system , lots of conflicts .
There were conflicting instructions within the instructions themselves .
It also does not have the great water flow that previous versions have had .
The flex tubing took a lot of abuse and it never cracked or broke .
I used the white one for about 10 years with no problems .
: I didn &apos; t care much for this CD .
basically , a failure - more on Victoria than Vincent : Technically , the writing style is very poor .
Sent the wrong part : The company sent me the wrong part .
Terrible finish to Lonesome Dove .
Very disappointed in Larry &apos; s ending , give me Return To Lonesome Dove any day of the week .
I &apos; m a male BPD and am angry at the oblique , reverse bias so obvious in this book .
She throws a tantrum and gets &apos; support &apos;!?!
ridiculous : I usually enjoy psychology - related books , but this one was ridiculous !
He must be a fool .
Disappointment : This hand - held shower head doesn &apos; t have the usual force associated with a shower .
The massage is weak and not at all invigorating .
I am not happy with this purchase .
The real problem is that the hose they use now is way too rigid for the application .
Even that movie is far and above better than &quot; Shadow Hunter ,&quot; but do not let this discourage you .
Ghost : I triedTo watch this movie six or seven times .
Barely a Mention of Slavery !
It was clumsily wrapped in plastic , the case is damaged and yellowed .
The one for the Town Car is great , but they sent me the wrong one for the second car .
And that is sad .
Dopey movie , bad message : &quot; Grease &quot; is a dopey movie , with silly jokes , innuendo , and fluffy songs .
But this is only part of what is wrong with the movie .
Worst of all is the message it sends : girls if you want to keep your boyfriend go lose on him .
It fades in and out and is difficult to watch .
a disappointment : Sort of like a sausage with a lot of ingredients thrown together but no mixture .
Thats when the problems started .
One day it froze up , but I reset it , no problem .
As one could imagine , it &apos; s completely useless now .
Frustrating , dulls quickly : I have used this peeler only a few times and it is already quite dull .
I don &apos; t care who is in power on earth .
Plus , the killing of Sister Carlotta was a waste .
It was a bad book .
NO MUSIC ???
I &apos; ll consider buying this DVD set when the aforementioned mistake is corrected .
Fire that fool and bring back the original songs .
What a stupid idea to change the music ...... moron .
Worse than a &quot; b &quot; movie : Not worth the time and trouble .
Wondering how any one could have fallen for that babysitter .
However when I went to use it it leaked everytime I would spray it .
Many problems : I &apos; ve owned this watch ( the black one ) for about a year now .
Overall , I think Polar products have gotten worse over the years .
Disappointing : We have only the paring knife from this set , and havebeen very disappointed with it .
The knife lost its edge quickly , and worse yet , fell apart a few months after we bought it .
Okay ... BIG MISTAKE !
A great bit part for Jackie Chan , but a TERRIBLE movie !
This is a waste of money to purchase .
There was no Augustus Pelltier !
I thought she sounded decent on one song and she &apos; s not that great on the first album either .
Very disappointed .
Waste of Popcorn : I saw this movie at the cinema .
It must stands for &quot; A very Bad book on C !
The teaching style is TERRIBLE !
You will only regret the purchase .
Self - Serving : Reading the book was slow and painful .
The writing style is boring and slow to the point of sleep .
I regret buying the book !
Unfortunately , I really didn &apos; t get much out of it .
I found this rather useless .
&quot; Dude , Where &apos; s My Car &quot; was better : Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen this year .
It really was that bad .
This movie is a waste of your money .
He deleted any scene dipicting him as he was originally written , as a bad person .
They should ban these people from any race tracks .
Now fogs immediately and is difficult to see in .
: This movie is SOOOOOOOOOO bad !
And how many times can you say &quot; Shark attack !
If you &apos; re going to see any of these movies , see Jaws : The Revenge .
A shame to kill so many innocent trees .
The author &apos; s argument is simple .
Instead , the author drags it out , and drags , and drags , and drags and ... you get the idea .
Very disappointing product .
I didn &apos; t make a good choice on this one .
Piece of Trash : This book &quot; Doing Battle , The Making of a Skeptic &quot; is really bad .
I was appalled at how bad both books were .
It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use .
This is not a worthy sequel to the legendary JAWS .
It &apos; s stupid , the mechanical shark looks like a giant piranha , and its just boring .
Whatever happened to Amity island ? This peice of junk is pathetically unsuspenseful .
That &apos; s it . A cheap waste of money .
As a child I saw this one also and it scared me , I was in the video saw and decided to rent it .
Not good at all ...: This movie is so awful that you have to see it !
The effects are really bad and they used very similar scenes from the original Jaws .
The photography was so bad that you couldn &apos; t tall if someone was dead or alive .
After I saw it I was really embarrassed for the director , Joe Alves .
&quot; Most of the visuals look cheesy , and the fact that the film is set in Sea World doesn &apos; t help .
Even its 3 - D effects are weak .
You don &apos; t care about them as people so the movie is dull .
Wow .. a shark is in our backyard pool .. how can we kill it .. I know .. let &apos; s go down in the water .
Very , very bad : Where do I begin ?
( Has Dennis Quaid been in a movie in which drinking wasn &apos; t his main talent ?
THE worst movie ever : I guess I have to give it a score !
Terrible special effects and really bad acting . What were they thinking ?
Just terrible !
Worst Movie Ever Made : This was the worst movie ever created .
I always been an Arnold fan , but boy was I wrong .
I wasted 6 . 50 on a real sleaper .
From the numerous things that made this movie sad was the Bible ignorance .
The taking out of scriptures was real bad .
: A complete waste of money , not even worth seeing .
Not even worth one star -- but Amazon . com doesn &apos; t give an option for no stars .
This movie was really bad ...: Sorry , but I thought this movie was horrible .
Only two other movies are on my list for horrible movies , and this is one of them .
The acting was horrible .
I can &apos; t believe Gabriel Byrne wasted his time on this movie .
It wasn &apos; t an expensive gift but it was a gift nonetheless .
It was very disappointing .
This Product SUCKS !
Lots of stains not listed : I was very disappointed with this book .
I saw it on Oprah and thought that I had to have it because I &apos; m not very good with laundry .
From graphic oral sex ( Michael on Sharon ) to a near rape scene , this movie is just too much for me .
). Go ahead and call me prude , but I cannot recommend this filthy trash .
It &apos; s a shame : Poor Kirk Douglas !
This CD is an absolute waste of money .
Some parts are entertaining but others are degrading .
Boring Story .
This book failed to deliver either .
The characters stuck to every stereotype .
fuentes : i was unaware that this was an instructors edition and was very upset when i received it .
This book is terrible !
To make matters worse , the story is derivative and cliche .
These are scared little boys - with large guitars ( and that &apos; s about it ).
I even heard ( the usually acceptable ) Rob Riener made a movie about these perverts !
Is the whole male world going crazy ?
Sequins , swearing and silliness : Barney meets the Godfather .
Lots of violence and cussing but nothing interesting .
But don &apos; t take your kids -- it &apos; s very violent . Obviously , I don &apos; t recommend it !
Horrid Film : This is still to this day one of the most awful films i ever saw .
The movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more .
: The worst movie ever ?
It has done a good job for the past 5 years , but a month ago it broke on me .
Mine broke , too !
Hinge broke while crushing a small clove of garlic and the press was less than 3 months old !
* It broke in less than 3 months .
The rest are boring and flavorless .
DRAB : I found this book to be one of the poorer encounters of the Risorgimento .
She provides a lot of detail .. perhaps too much but fails to draw the attention of the audience .
Useless , Horrible , and Filled with Typos !
On every test , it always gives wrong line numbers and misspells many , many , many words .
And to top it off , the answer guide is often wrong .
This was the worst $ 10 that I have ever spent .
I would not recommend this for others !
Couldn &apos; t keep me interested .
My first reading experience with a James Alexander Thom book was , unfortunately , not a good one .
thinking this might be just as good .... boy , was I wrong !!
I think it was a waste of money .
disappointment : I am a big Randy Neuman fan , but did not like this CD .
Bummer !
SUCH A BUMMER !
Not Faithfully Reproduced : This Kindle edition is not accurately reproduced .
Between Loc 2416 and 2447 is a different part of the book . This kind of error is shameful .
Long and stupid .
: I didn &apos; t really enjoy reading this book .
I &apos; m serious , this album is boring .
but on the other hand the lyrics are so bad that i feel dumb for tuning in .
not worth the time of a long time fan : This story greatly disappointed me .
It &apos; s horrible !
Ugly Americanism !
Not happy : When I got my nozzles , they where not what is shown in the pictures , you show here !
We set it up and tried for a few hours , and then we feel extremely disappointed .
kind of boring : You know , I have to apologetically say I didn &apos; t really like this too much .
You won &apos; t miss anything by taking this route and passing on this relatively useless book .
OXO Fail .
I thought they could do no wrong .
But this apple corer / divider was a waste of money .
It does not work any better at all !
The apple gets stuck in it , and it &apos; s a pain to clean .
The middle screw is loose and doesn &apos; t completely tighten .
: Most of the OXO products hold up but this grater broke grating cheddar cheese .
overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
THE JAZZBAKERY IS A SHAM , AND RUTH PRICE OUGHT TO HANG HER HEAD IN SHAME !
That &apos; s not exactly a compliment for you Mr . Charyn .
&quot; His hatred of European Americans ( whites ) belies his own research .
: Blame a victim anyone ?
Now that &apos; s just sad .
I am very disappointed with this product .
Sorely disappointed : This was on my wishlist for a sometime .
I love salads , but hate trying in vain to dry washed lettuce with a mountain of paper towels .
Sorely , sorely disappointed .
NO , I have owned it for 3 months .
when called they say it was delivered so to bad .
I &apos; ve tried adding a couple ( or more ) paper towels - that didn &apos; t help .
I &apos; ve tried putting less lettuce , that didnt help either .
In fact , Death To The Pixies puts too much focus on some of their lesser , later work .
Pixies were an album band , and compilations only degrade their impact .
This book was not helpful in preparing my driving tour .
The maps have no detail and serve no real purpose .
never made a bad album , but as a trio ; they stunk !
After a few uses the blade seemed to lose its sharpness .
No No and No .
I never cared too much for Aunt Bam simply because she is soo freakin loud !
I decided to be more open minded but that was an epic FAIL .
Not all black aunts are loud and obnoxious .
singer , but she was no acter .
She was tight nahh I &apos; m lying , she was wack and couldn &apos; t write a song at all .
I have read afew and found them to be consistant in quality , that being low , very low .
I &apos; m doubly damned .
I was expecting something a bit more descriptive and was disappointed .
Not the best !
I am really disappointed .
A complete waste of time : This is a terrible book .
If You Hate Your Kids : Smells Worse Than a Dirty Hamster Cage ...: Wait , stop !
I know what you are thinking : &quot; This film is obviously bad , why on Earth did you watch it ?
Nope , I don &apos; t know what that approach would be ; but this film took the wrong one .
Giant explosions and a giant robot attack the wise - cracking guinea pigs .
Negatively speaking this has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that I have ever seen .
I never really cared if the rodents suceeded in their mission or not .
Horrible : Used this cutting board for 8 days before it warped .
Terrible : An experiment : 1 .
I really found this book disgusting , confusing , and morbid .
It was disgusting how she discribed the ritual for her to get pregnant .
What kind of author would actually write about beig a handmaid , especially if it &apos; s not true ?
I was actually traumatized by this book .
But it has a weakness in its teaching sequence .
Why were three teenaged boys so bad to the bone ?
It &apos; s just a high pitch that hurts my ears .
this solo one is not a good purchase ..
Do not under any circumstance waste your time with this .
not the best : This bottle opener is too thin and doesn &apos; t work really good .
Garbage : I couldn &apos; t agree more with the other negative reviews on this site .
the worst movie ever [.
Dont get this movie confused with Jackie &apos; s box office smash Rumble In The Bronx .
Very dissatisfied
Yet another false alarm review : So , here I am at 03 : 34 AM writing a review for a smoke detector .
mad chirping : this product is the obsolute worst and it took me six years to discover this .
we bought our house brand new and it was already equipped with this smoke alarm system .
Based on the other descriptions I am NOT holding out hope .
They send out a different , inferior model .
Lasko did not respond to emails regarding the problem .
Dishonest advertising .
DOA : Almost bought this from Amazon , but instead got it from Home Depot , and avoided the shipping .
Unfortunately this fan was dead on arrival .
The book fails in its primary function , as a reference work .
Misspelling and mistakes dog almost every page .
Did you know that Crassus died in both 55 and 53BC ?
This book is mindless drivel .
I feel sorry for anyone who has actually read this insincere , unimportant , uninformed &quot; book &quot;.
We &apos; re not laughing with you , we &apos; re laughing at you .
No no no !
: The last page of this book was as tediously painful to read as the first .
Butler &apos; s pompous writing is by far a worse sin than any committed by his vapid characters .
To top it off , Drew Berrymore starred in it and this was the most disappointing thing .
She is such a beutiful and talented actress and to see her waste her time off this mess is a shame .
Terrible !
It is an OXO product , what could go wrong !
She is a whiney and weak character who just gets more annoying as the book progresses .
I was just annoyed that I had wasted my time on this book .
Wish I could give it a negative star !!
: This book was one of the most boring coming - of - age novels I have ever read .
Lee Fiora bored the s #*!
Lee failed to evolve in 4 yrs and I could not relate or empathyze with her in any way .
Boring !
The main character of this book doesn &apos; t grow , and she has nothing interesting to say .
She has a miserable sexual relationship that just kind of goes on and on .
Prep : I was so disappointed by this book .
Long , painful and incredibly boring : I absolutely hated this book .
in the scene where he slaps her for being rude and distant to her family .
Marsha Mason &apos; s character is constantly cranky and critical .
Dead Cat Bounce just seemed to meander .
So disappointed with this bowl !
I received a medium , but the cut of the tank is either a large or extra large .
And it is all that , but I have had it for only 2 - 3 months and is already broken .
One of the buckles broke early on during transport or use , not sure .
: From the amount of money I spent on this thing I was extremly disappointed .
I tried a head - cleaner tape but it didn &apos; t help one bit .
Really , the most interesting character is the woman who gets killed in the opening chapter .
This phone is a piece of crap !
I really regret buying this phone !!!
My biggest upset was the battery life .
Needless to say I keep the one I had and it hasn &apos; t got any better .
Susceptible to Humidity : External display failed within one month .
Moisture sensor dot showed red , so Verizon would not honor warranty .
I understand others have had similar humidity problems too , especially with the Motorola phones .
The book is dark and deals with sexual issues and family violence .
I &apos; m not saying the book is without merit .
: Very unhappy with this book .
Black and white pictues of buttons are not very useful in identification .
AWFUL vacuum .
: This vacuum is terrible !
: This vacuum sucks , literally and figuratively .
Both my wheels continually pop off while I am cleaning and it is a total bother .
Unfortunately the video got ahead of the audio and I kept having to stop and restart .
What a loss !
: Very poor IR quality , the ear cushions come off with ease and the kids lost two the first day .
The volume is very low .
Don &apos; t waste your money : I went to see this horrible movie with my father and I was dissapointed .
It is scary , but the plot is stupid .
And how can the family dog die ?
I was very mad about this .
This is a fake !
Jay Anson wrote a fake story .
One Of The Worst Ghost Movies Of All Time : I just don &apos; t see how this could get such good reviews .
It &apos; s an awful movie with awful acting and no horror at all .
The sequels are ok and would get a 5 / 10 from me but this one horrible .
A young family moves into a nice new house onlt to find out it &apos; s haunted and the dad goes crazy .
MGM also did a bad job on this disk for we get a trailer and that &apos; s all .
Don &apos; t waste your money : What a horrible movie !
It tastes awful unless you mix it with Apple Juice and water .
taste awful : smell bad and taste awful .
awful : This is the most bland , uninteresting tripe released this year .
Bad DVD : I like Tom Petty but this DVD is bad .
Poor editing too .
The audio is bad also .
I have a 7 . 1 surround sound setup and this audio just sounds bad .
Awful : The format is silly and the exercises too simple .
I was very disappointed .
God , what a horrible mean and controlling woman -- famous jockey or no .
There was no suspense and the only frightening thing was that I purchased the movie new .
This one stinks , badly .
horrible record !
I was unfortunate enough to see their live show and I must say it is worse than the record .
Hell Yes !
But even with that aside , this is really just pretentious crap , I mean ... hell !
Big Disappointment !!!
The casting was alright , but such horrible writing !
The worst part was their attempt at a girl - girl scene .
A waste of time and money !
I hate bugs and the bugs in this game are driving me nuts .
One bug that is really bothering me is the inability to alt - tab out , or when someone messages me .
The Worst Bellow Book ?
Within a few months of owning the pot , the handle to the water reservoir broke .
No problem , I just screwed it back in .
The handle was permanently broken .
Unfortunately , it has began rusting inside where the spout meets the kettle .
The handle on ours started to come loose within a month or so .
The problem is inherent on the design .
Not Recommended : I like nothing about this kettle .
Tracy : This teakettle is the worst !
The internal fuse also blew - out when I was overseas rendering it useless .
Tried using it in Germany , and it failed .
It is thus completely useless , and I am returning both of the ones I purchased .
Wrong sizing and inconsistent sizing : I received two of these shirts of the same size .
I have shown dogs only 3 years and found this book not very good .
When they sent me the wrong part , I had to pay shipping both ways and a re - stocking charge .
Not worth your time : B and low budget horror is typically my favorite genre .
Unfortunately , this movie doesn &apos; t achieve any of those elements .
The &quot; horror &quot; parts are simply awful .
There &apos; s a scene of a witch stabbing people who have to be standing 20 &apos; away .
0 STARS : HORRIBLE !!!
Bad acting , bad filming , nothing realy scary .
Poor Quality : Poor quality , will not last .
Not good quality : This is very cheaply made .
Two of the doors on the compartments were nearly broken off upon arrival .
what a disappointment !
My kids have been wanting to see this , but again , I must say no .
Can &apos; t believe I bought this : One word for this cd : HORRIBLE .
I tried to listen to this four times and hated it more with each play .
I can &apos; t begin to tell you how awful this cd is .
This actually hurt to watch .
Waste of Money !
Waste of money !
: I was really disappointed in this title ....
Came damaged but is also cheap : I was disappointed with this product .
The tab is broken on one of the days , which makes it very hard to open .
? I enjoyed the illistrations but the word &quot; towel head &quot; deeply disturbed both my daughter and I !
horrible translation : i am a muslim myself .
Additionally , it doesn &apos; t do that great a job of sifting even after all that effort .
The flour gets under the agitator and clogs the screen after a few shakes .
I was not pleased with this product .
Audio is terrible : This is VHS to DVD creation that has horrible audio quality .
I absoloutly hated it .
I &apos; m sorry but it &apos; s just bad music .
Damaged book !
The pages would not detatch so I had to cut them .
This left the pages damaged .
Now the book is in damaged condition .
This &quot; Drive I - 95 &quot; was very disappointing to me .
Too bad the edition outdated .
hate it : this movie is a waste of money .
to boring not enough dancing .
errors are abundant : I bought this book as a first step to preparing for the ASTB .
Certain sections left me more confused than when i started due to so many mistakes .
The author should be ashamed to publish something with so many obvious errors .
Not as Helpful as it could be : Very basic book , not a large section for what I wanted .
The Countess in Red : Dreary and SO poorly written I could have cried !
I have seldom seen a work with such flimsy plot and utterly insipid characters .
What a shame !
The picture still works but the audio no longer comes through .
It was broken out of the box .
: This is an adequate ladle , but my husband cut himself quite badly while washing it .
No sir , I don &apos; t like it .
Not Fun : This game is not much fun .
Despicable bad guys inexplicably dying ?
Not very fun : My baby boy never liked this .
All in all a disappointment .
That tells me this is very low quality stainless steel .
Not user friendly !
Corny and meaningless lyrics and pathetic &quot; musicianship &quot;.
I read some of it but don &apos; t care to be categorized simply because I want to know what &apos; s out there .
Unfortunately the other reviewers are spot on -- very bendy handles .
I hate to replace new ( expensive ) items , but I use them every day and am not happy .
If it &apos; s bad - they time you out and won &apos; t let it post .
I have never been so disappointed in all my life .
This is awful .
Amazon should remove this farce from their inventory !
Extremely disappointing .
This wanders around ultimately gets lost and is a waste of time and money .
Flowery descripitons of every detail do not make a good book .
No doubt about it , someone else wrote it .
The plot was improbable , disjointed .
I hate looking for another author !
He desperately wants to see the real world .
Overall this book was not to good .
DON &apos; T READ THE GIVER : IT IS ABOUT A KID NAMED JONAS AND AN OLD GUY WHO GIVES JONAS BAD MEMORIES .
IT IS BAD .
THIS IS SICK !
I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE SOME OF THE THINGS WRITTEN IN A KIDS BOOK .
CHILDREN DO NOT NEED TO READ IN DETAIL HOW JONAS &apos; FATHER KILLED A BABY .
THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINING !
I had to read this for English , and I have hated my teacher since for making me read this .
This book just bored me to death , reading it was like pulling eyeteeth .
After a point , I didn &apos; t even care !!
In short , a creepy book about a futuristic society that bored me to death .
How sad : My step daughter had to read this book for school .
I found this book very depressing and not edifiying in any way .
How sad .
Or I &apos; m just too dumb to read into things .
It is such a ridiculous idea that a world and its inhabitants do not have any feelings or memories .
Scnhier hasn &apos; t found a way to go beyond his own fear .
WORST soundtrack ever : this has to be the worst soundtrack ever .
most of mtv &apos; s soundtracks aren &apos; t very good , but this is the worst .
This made it a difficult text to read .
No matter , the cleaner is useless to me .
its not as good as i expected .
Knockout blackjack , Caro &apos; s book of tells and blackjack blackbelt are a waste of money .
), but almost certain to fail even on its own terms .
Tai chi beginning practice , David - Dorian Ross : This was a total waste of money !
A lot of Yadda yadda , blah , blah , blah !!!
In other words , NO EXERCISE , just talk .
! Awful , awful , awful .
I will try it again but now I would not recommend it to others
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog .
OUT OF DATE N A RIP OFF : I purchased this item and to my surprise it was horrible .
It is not true .
The title had NO connection to anything in the book .
: I &apos; m so sad about this book .
One little whisper of wind , it was knocked over and one of the metal frames broke .
Horrible acting , horrible script , horrible effects , and horrible story .
To me , this movie had no redeeming qualities , and it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen .
You &apos; ll learn Flash alright .... but it &apos; ll bore you to death !!
Dino Thunder Sleeping Bag : My son loved the idea of a sleeping bag but it &apos; s not very comfortable .
Mess Maker : My wife must have nearly one of every red Kitchen Aid products .
My last Starbucks grinder failed because of a frayed cord ( from wrappping around the cylinder ).
Unfortunately it will last forever .
Messy , messy , messy .
Also , removable bowl is not very easy to remove ; and requires tweaking to re seat .
Not as good as I thought it would be .
She was an ER doctor yet when it came to danger she was a wuss .
Why did certain people have to die ?
Book has a misleading title .
He is full of lies and Total Mis - Truths !!
i &apos; ve been Wiccan for over 10years and WE DON &apos; T WORSHIP SATAN OR EVEN BELIEVE IN A SATAN !
Besides this idiot claims to to have been a UFO abductee and a vampire !
This book is a long , contrived , boring piece of unrealistic drivel .
The characters are underdeveloped and frighteningly unrealistic ( not to mention just plain stupid .
Possibly the worst movie I ever watched : This movie is not worth the time wasted watching it .
I repeat , TERRIBLE MOVIE !!!!!!!!!
Horrible writing , horrible acting : I just saw this movie .
Only see Sin City if you want to laugh yourself sick .
but it is boring , slow , and long .
child rapists !
brutal murder !
Sin City : Typical Quentin Tarantino film .
It was actually the worst movie I have ever seen .
The characters are shot time and time again , and yet live on with barely any signs of suffering .
Just violence and hookers .
This movie was beyond horrible .
Hate these kinds of releases though .
Boring !
Are male comic - book authors so dull in their senses ?
This movie was crap !
I could appreciate the gratuitous nudity , but the continuous violence was a turn off .
Nothing like the original kong : I don &apos; t like this toy .
Not for aggresive chewers : I have a brutally aggressive chewer ( 35 lb springer spaniel mix ).
She has not done any additional damage to the main body of the ball .
Useless for non chewers : Stuffing treats inside isnt useful as they pop out too easily .
Dog destroyed it within 30 minutes : The toy lasted about 30 minutes .
This printer was listed as NEW but arrived USED AND BROKEN , I did what AMOZON told me too do .
The person that you photographed will have their head cut off !
Disappointed : I bought this phone because of the range and speaker phone feature .
The battery in the handset died after only two months and a replacement never charged .
Some can edges appear to be different heights which probably contributes to the problem .
Not fun !!
I find it very difficult to puncture a can and get it started running .
It seems that the design makes the leverage all wrong .
Disappointed : This device does open cans but it is difficult to position to get it started .
One star is too many : This gizmo is a costly dud .
I must have made a mistake , I thought , so I stupidly bought another $ 25 box of test strips .
Now , the machine simply rejects the lot number which you must dial in .
This is ridiculous .
His time line is a mess .
He space is just as bad as he provides no sense of the geography or the role it played .
Everything about this movie SUCKED .
Learn from my mistake : DONT DO IT .
Awful and Amateur .
Very poor for such a well known company .
I am very disappointed at this product .
It is very disappointing !
However , it is bad history .
This book is very much inferior to Hofschroer &apos; s work .
Not good .
These shoes are boring .
At worst it is over extravagance that doesn &apos; t know what it &apos; s trying to be .
Because they know they can fool the conumer into buying this tripe .
Shameful Packaging : 42 years later and Sgt .
Shame on you Amazon and E . M . I .!
They just didn &apos; t CARE .
Bad book !!
I regret that .
but the end is weak and dumb .
the boy barbie hooks up with is extremely vulgar and wrong .
BORING , repetitive , and not as tough .
Somewhat disturbing .
Total Crap : Pitiful book filled with more conjecture than fact .
waste of time and money : I should have read the reviews a little closer .
: I was incredibly disappointed in this book .
THIS JUST IN : KINSEY MILLHONE LOSES HER VOICE !
But P is for Peril marks the first book by Grafton at her new publisher .
You lost a once - dedicated fan ....
Then the end of the book came and what a disappointment .
It was confusing and left you feeling that you had just wasted your time reading the book .
What a disappointment .
This book was SO BORING I had difficulty staying awake to finish it .
Shame on you Sue Grafton .
P for &quot; P U &quot;: The only &quot; peril &quot; in this book was the disappointment at the end .
What a disappointment !
Worst than the First : Saw I had promise and and descended in to a plot mess .
Let &apos; s not play anymore little games !
I really liked the first Saw , and HATED this sequel .
This movie sucks bad .
: Its about a bunch of people who are locked in a house and die in different ways .
No seriously .
Its violent .
Nothing is cited , even the direct quotes have no citations !
How was this so bad ?
: This movie had two top stars and a pretty good plot , but somehow turned out horrible !
Ive seen a lot of movies recently and this is by far the worst .
I &apos; ll tell you his story : I &apos; m drunk , I &apos; m nobody ; I &apos; m drunk , I &apos; m famous ; I &apos; m drunk , I &apos; m ^%*&%$* dead !
The water leaked out all over the counter and floor .
Will continue to try , but would not recommend it based on my experience .
What was worse was that few if any of the songs even hinted and being memorable .
It is very odd looking .
And way boring .
This is just sick , bring a pillow
I have the DTS version but no DTS processer and had to select the enhanced stereo setting .
So far no other DVD I &apos; ve purchased compares in overall quality .
Not a Good One at All !
But when he is at sea for five days I got tired of reading it and wanted to stop the book .
I &apos; m not sure and I &apos; m probably wrong .
However , if your trying to die of boredom this is the book for you .
Not that the writing style isn &apos; t good , not that the story isn &apos; t interesting .
Unfortunately , this wasn &apos; t the case with Old Man And the Sea .
I recognized the metaphors about life , but I didn &apos; t care because the story just wasn &apos; t engaging .
Rinse and repeat . I thought maybe re - reading it as an adult might change my perspective , but no .
It &apos; s still boring .
addcaptivating ... it was just plain dull .
DISAPPOINTING : I won &apos; t go into the details of the plot itself .
There is very little tension .
What does it matter if someone stole this or destroyed that ?
The completely evil villain ; the sad , ever moral good guy .
Vesuvius in ancient Greece ), you will be disappointed .
B - O - R - I - N - G : Dull and dopey .
Gross .
They &apos; re just really messy and difficult to eat in this condition , so I &apos; m giving two stars .
This woman is an conceited idiot , and this book is a waste of time and money .
Had to wait 2 months for library to acquire it . Have never been so disappointed in anything .
! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME !!
It was so disappointing .
Boring , Obvious and predictable : I was very disappointed with this listenandlive title .
You could easily feel his pain when he is forced into an asylum for the insane .
However , the book &apos; s heroin , Maddy , was a bit out of control .
Could she be more indecisive ?
After a month there was a problem with one of the pedals .
The problem was fixed for about a month until the same problem reoccurred .
I was very disappointed .
) Guy With Fin : Sorry to wreck the scene , guys !
I lost my deal . By the way , that scene is better than the whole movie combined . LOCAL EVIL MONKEY
Possibly the WORST movie ever made !
: This is the worst acting in a children &apos; s movie that I have EVER seen .
unbox turned to crap : I hate to say it but unbox has turned to crap !
Spy Kids was okay but this was stupid .
We now constantly have to pop the leg back into place and it causes much distress for my baby .
And lets face it , they get dirty .
Pieces snap out for cleaning , and no paint chips !
It &apos; s exhausting .
It &apos; s boring .
What I found was boredom and frustration , some red herrings , and a mystery not worth my time .
Weak characters , poor plot : I was not a fan of this novel .
It got off to a bad start in the opening chapters because the main character is so unlikeable .
From that point forward , I didn &apos; t care one way or the other what happened to him .
Ray Jackson is a self - absorbed architect , whose wife Leigh leaves him after a fight .
It &apos; s a horrible story , with a confusing plot and no real crime .
acting was fairly poor .
Total Crap !
This author can &apos; t be trusted .
He & his men built the city from the dirt up .
It is basically useless .
Dead on arrival : Our Dell PC wouldn &apos; t boot up with this DIMM installed .
Memory for my Dell laptop : I added this card and every time I boot I get a new error message .
: First problem , the RCA adapter was missing that was supposed to be included .
Useless product : The headphones has a constant hiss .
But that is not the case . Not sure if the signal is just too weak from the transmitters .
The hiss is annoying and unbearable .
Popping noise : Just bought these yesterday and disappointed to hear popping noise every 30 sec .
worthless junk : worthless junk - both before and after &apos; fully charging &apos; [ 16 hours !]
unacceptable level of noise : The popping and clicking noise is unbearable .
I &apos; m very disappointed at this Sony product . So why do some people give five - star rating ?
They don &apos; t have this problem ???
Or just can &apos; t trust some of the online reviews .
13 PEOPLE REVIEWED THIS MESS ; 11 GAVE ONE STAR : AVERAGE 1 . 5 STARS ?
This mess lost me about 20 IQ points .
hotel condemned : The &quot; Special Features &quot; section said this movie had no script .
Well , the story was okay , but the writing wasn &apos; t very good , unlke his other books .
Not his best work .....: This book Isn &apos; t as good as I would hope .
It is to brief , it gets scary in the last twenty pages .
Disappointed : I read Cry Me A River as a book club reading , and I was very disappointed .
Along with &apos; The Mask &apos; one of Koontz &apos; s worst ever .
Why are the nuts chasing ?
It is dreadful .
Very disappointing and the only album I have ever bought that has been so badly pressed .
Really disappointed after reading the reviews .
I was highly disappointed .
This freakish movie had a flimsy plot , not to mention an unbelieveably stupid ending .
It starts with serial killing and ends on an off - balanced tangent .
I was highly disappointed .
Don &apos; t get your hopes up yet though .
Most of the girls aren &apos; t that hot and a lot of their vaginas aren &apos; t the best looking either .
Hers in the worst .
: Boring video for a couple .
Also the firewire is a pain in the behind its just more money you have to throw away .
: Parents will be forced to slog through weak character plots that move at a glacial pace .
I would not recommend this movie to anyone , and basically ignore that it was ever made .
You were a favorite .... less then one star ... sad James , sad .
: After the total fiasco of The Lake House , I was looking forward to getting back to Alex Cross .
However , this book was a disappointment .
not your vintage patterson : this is a disappointing book .
However I am getting tired of them ... almost as tired as his plotlines .
The Worst Author I Have Ever Read : Patterson &apos; s writing is an insult to one &apos; s intelligence .
I couldn &apos; t finish this book ( a Christmas gift ) it was so bad .
What I got was a terrible version .
I can &apos; t tell you how disappointed I was !
Missing features , limited lifespan : Where is the FM tuner ?
What a waste of time !
Also ripe for blame are political ideology and territorial ambition .
It doesn &apos; t seem reasonable to blame religion for a common human failing .
Clarke has managed to give us no answers , while leaving the story no where to go .
Oh brother ...: After reading 2061 , I had a nagging feeling that AC Clarke was going insane .
It &apos; s sad to see an author slowly lose his skill and interest .
The rest was crap .
And frankly , I don &apos; t think that the monoliths can be beaten by some computer virus .
Ugh : If you want scifi go elsewhere .
If you want an arrogant polemic then this is your book .
What a waste of time ( pun fully intended ).
I really do think Mr Clarke was fighting a deadline to get this one out .
Too bad it &apos; s really poorly constructed .
Santa thought he was bringing a great toy , but it was really bad .
Having a Garage Sale : Stop !
Lame Attempt !
You should be ashamed of yourself Steve Roose .
Hey I &apos; m going to trademark the term video and sue you for making a video , idiot !
Seriously , this thing is so boring it will suck the life out of any party .
STUPID .
Terrible !
I was disappointed .
Not good .
Not good at all .
his worst : Absolutely the worst album of Marilyn Manson .
Buy this CD only if you need it desperately for your MM collection .
Not Lisa Papineau &apos; s Pet : Don &apos; t make the same mistake i did .
This &quot; Pet &quot; is a horrible britpop male fronted band not fit to shine Lisa Papineau &apos; s boots .
This cd is dated 2004 , years after the real Pet broke up .
Disappointing .
The audio mix on &quot; One Day More &quot; is inexcusably bad .
not like the pic : this item is not at all like what is shown in the picture at all .
I feel bad , but I just can &apos; t .
And in case no one else has pointed it out , &quot; simply grande &quot; is an oxymoron .
But I &apos; m boring about this .
But my 2 . 5 - year - old was bored with it and didn &apos; t want to watch it again .
Duped !
Boy was I wrong !
It &apos; s a series from the 50s or 60s with lame graphics and commentary .
Don &apos; t buy this DVD because it &apos; s just not very good .
I was so shocked at how cheap it felt that I cut it in two to see what it was made of .
Memory upgrade : We bought these to upgrade a couple of older Dell computers ... waste of money .
Clumsy : Lousy movie .
Almost as bad as Lost in Space .
It was boring .
Didn &apos; t give me much guidance : I was really disappointed with this book .
What a waste !
I couldn &apos; t get past disc 3 , despite being interested in the story .
And I &apos; m sad to have had to write that .
died : bought the kettle about 6 months ago .
I had the unit serviced and the problem still remains .
Unfortunately it fails to deal with the major issues on dhtml .
I was expecting a lot from this edition , but after watching it I was very disappointed .
The new music score is also very disappointing .
And I won &apos; t even go into how terrible the acting is in the new scenes .
The added scenes were terrible !
but be warned , it &apos; s not the real thing .
For a start the 15 minutes of added footage is NEWLY FILMED and awful .
Not only that , it suffers from really bad lip - sync problems that make it practically unwatchable .
The other disc contains the un - butchered original but unfortunately has a new music score .
NO 3 - D FILM HAS EVER WORKED FOR ME ON TV !
: This 30th Anniversary Edition is pathetic .
Each and every one of these things made it worse .
She &apos; s also the only one who appears to know what is going on and how to the defeat the bad guy .
Poor story , bad acting , crap movie .
Too chatty ; no data , no drawings , poor bibliography .
Sadly nowhere on the page was it explained that this was a MINI version , a pamphlet indeed .
poor quality .
: cheap and poor quality , looks very thin .
I think it is the way waste moneyI would not buy it again .
Not happy that I now have to take time to return and find a different pizza oven now .
Everyone in my class thinks this book sucks !
Reader beware your in for the dull trip of your life !
The reason towards this is because it was dull boring and put me to sleep .
But the lack of any basic formatting made me delete it right away .
The towns people were frightened because the monster was ugly and different from them .
It &apos; s not an easy read , nor a happy one .
It &apos; s filled with obsessive compulsion , depression , denial , murder , and God - playing by man .
THE WRONG ITEM !!!!
not good : If I did not have to read this for school I never would have read it .
Awful : This book is chock full of arrogant , racist nonsense .
Everyone tries but the script is WEAK .
The color is so bad everything looks pastel when any color other than green can be decerned .
I watched this on a home theatre system and the sound was nothing special but alright .
I won &apos; t buy from Amazon again if I should receive another such poor quality product .
Another inferior product by Madacy : bleached out picture and tinny sound .
I regret that I did .
However , the Kindle version is almost useless .
Now we have listen to a solos cd by the world &apos; s dumdest fake brunette .
Not good !
: Is this music screaming or singing ?
I am very unimpressed by her debut album .
Overall , this is not a good debut .
There isn &apos; t a memorable melody in the bunch , and that &apos; s a crime .
Now we have listen to a solos cd by the world &apos; s dumdest fake brunette .
Disappointed - cd empty : I waited over the 30 days to open and test the product .
Bad design , bad headset .
I &apos; ve currently replaced these headphones 3 times . The first two times the microphone died .
Step away for a few minutes or get distracted and Bam .. Lost connection .
Poor Construction : We purchased this Pill Organizer after using the same type for a few years .
I tried to put them back but no luck . Very poorly built - low quality .
It has a 6 month warranty and therefore , I lost $ 80 . 00 . I am very disappointed in the quality .
worst product ever .
The good sound quality is of no use if the item is broken !
We were very disappointed .
One side broke after a couple weeks .
The sound is okay , but the biggest problem is that they don &apos; t fit very well in the ear .
Then I push them back on my ear , but then I lose ALL bass response .
Defective Product : The earphones are defective .
It took a while to recieve the product and the product was defective .
Not a good buy .
I have wasted so much money as I am the headphone queen !
I thought maybe I had a defective pair or I had been too clumsy , so I ordered another pair .
Broken in 3 weeks : I got these to replace my yellow Sony sports headphones .
These broke within 3 weeks .
Unfortunately , I recently found the headband broken inside my gym bag , and now they are unusable .
I do not recommend these since they are much too fragile !
It &apos; s hard to believe the quality has declined so badly .
confused : I just opened it today , and I am disappointed .
I really don &apos; t know if they shipped the wrong item . It is supposed to be 28 &quot; by 3ft .
The sound is terrible .
: We really tried to watch this but the sound was so bad , it couldn &apos; t be understood at all .
I do not like this one at all : I had this music player before , and I have to admit , it &apos; s pathetic .
Atlantis Found Awful !
Smell is OK but nothing so special about it .
Wrong , wrong , wrong .
You CANNOT peel it off , and it looks awful when you are standing looking in .
Just a total waste for me .
There was no response at all - the unit was dead , and all attempts at revival failed .
My bad I guess .........
WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED TO READ !!!
It was written like a really bad book report .
Subpar : Many questions written poorly , in a very confusing language , useless info abundant .
If you &apos; re a cruiser rider you &apos; re all but forgotten .
Does not perform : This is the worst product I have ever purchased .
What a Horrid Waste of Pulp , A Disaster !
My eyes grow Tir &apos; d and my Thoughts grow more hateful towards this Author .
Confus &apos; d and Stupid Astronomers ?
All in all I felt the book totally lacking in character , and not well written - even boring .
: this album makes me sick .
if you think the cover is bad , wait till you hear the music !!!
Food Fight ?
The damn thing &apos; s full of cocaine !
I dunno if this is supposed to be a grown man &apos; s Pixie Stick or something , but I feel cheated .
Imagine my disappointment to find they terminated right in my living room .
That would sound worse and cost more .
What &apos; s this nonsense ???
Book design and illustrations are appalling considering the subject of the book .
The sound quality is poor .
The keychain is very small and not particularly attractive .
AVOID ANY PRODUCT BY SURROUND RECORDS !
I think this movie is boring .
The dialogue tends to sound either suspiciously American and modern , or archly dated .
Waste of time : Hmm , what to say about this game .
The AI was horrible , weapons were bland and boring to fire .
The teammate AI is horrible and doesn &apos; t help at all .
The graphics are horrible too .
Waste of money : If I were able to give zero stars , I would .
This tortilla baker doesn &apos; t do much , and an inferior job of cooking them .
Also the instruction book has , like , 4 pages / 2 recipes and not very useful .
The sound is pathetic .
Talk about disappointment !
Awful !
Now I think I think I wasted my money on that CD
I think to blame is to production quality .
Sorry folks , this is the worst Maiden album ever .
I tought this was the bottom for Maiden , until &quot; VIRTUAL ELEVEN &quot; came out and it was worse !!
Unacceptable for ordering school books , it put me behind on my class . Not reccomended .
sacred hunger : One of the most difficult , slow and overly detailed booksi have ever read .
I tried all three and was unsuccessful in recording or reading the disc on my Canon video camera .
It was that bad .
I like the idea of adopted children coming together to find their mother &apos; s killer .
But it was weak .
Waste of time : I got this film because I &apos; m from Detroit where this takes place .
Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother &apos; s killer .
Usual smartass remarks , guys talking BS , fights , shootouts , blah , blah , blah .
3 Lads , An American Fool and One Night : A really senseless piece of work .
But even at that it was a disappointment .
Delusions of granduer : Lizzie confuses candidness with insight .
The problem was the game felt hollow .
There was much less of a plot then any of the others in the series , and was overall disappointing .
Disappointing : Information not clear that product MUST be bolted down to be of any use .
Also the actual grining parts do not fit well .
To add to insult the grinder sent appeared to be a return or restock .
I was wrong .
They broke within a month .
missing pages !!
: This film is a disaster .
Ms . Knowles needs to stick to shaking her behind because acting is not a talent she possesses .
Do not waste precious minutes of your life watching this train wreck .
I was shocked -- we don &apos; t even have TV !
Everything is fake to them .
People don &apos; t go to plays to feel bad about life .
TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY !!!
Terrible transfer !!!
: I have about 4000 DVDs and have seen bad transfers in my life .
This DVD is one of the worst .
No and No !
Too Ridiculous !
The backwards episode was one of the few - perhaps the only one - on SEINFELD I did not care for .
I cannot enjoy the songs this way !!!
The movie is useless to me , because it won &apos; t play .
I was really looking forward to seeing this film from my childhood , but was very disappointed .
Very frustrating .
Not funny , not insightful , just trendy !
there was little plot .. if any apart from the stripper darla &apos; s struggle .
Just a sad tale of an equally sad boob !
A struggle : I finally had to put this away without finishing .
I found it tedious and not even remotely funny .
This book was not funny .
not funny !
I didn &apos; t laugh once through the first half of it which is how far I could stand to read .
It portrays a pathetic fat slob of a jerk that deserves all the bad that life deals him .
Not amused : The first chapter of this novel bored me to tears .
In my opinion , it was just ridiculous . The worst part of the book was the lack of plot .
What a loathsome , unpleasant bunch of idiots .
I stopped about a third of the way through chapter 2 , they irritated me so much .
I know I &apos; m in the minority , but I wouldn &apos; t recommend this book to anyone .
Terrible : This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read .
Ignatius &apos; s annoying outbursts of &quot; Oh my god !&quot;
I wanted to give it a one , but I don &apos; t want to be the worst &quot; Invalidator .&quot;
Someone killed my aunt , and is trying to kill me ?
I &apos; m going to be stupid and hang around investigating !
Worst helmet I ever bought .
: I had to read this book for my english class and i hated it .
It was incredibly boring .
Immoral and inappropriate for minors : I am not reviewing the story .
I am reviewing and warning parents about the content of this book .
This book should be banned from schools .
Kids get punished in school for using profanity yet the teachers are making them study this filth .
: I always knew Miley Cyrus was cold - hearted , but this movie lets us know she contains no emotion .
worst movie ever : The Last Song is in a league of its own .
It is by far and away the worst movie I have ever seen in my life .
Disappointed - no captions : I bought this for Dead .
Holstein to watch an it does not have closed captions so I am very disappointed .
It was a waste of money !
: The tip broke off this over priced piece of junk .
Makes a horrible grinding sound .
That it is still being sold is outrageous .
Wasting your time and money : Like wasting your time and money ?
I had simialr problems with my first Sharp machine , an earilier model .
Misleading !
Ugly Colors !!
: This bag is a very gross color of brown .
This is the most terrible movie I believe I have ever watched .
The acting was horrible , Bigfoot was an absolute joke along with every other aspect of this movie .
battery killer , poor pics : If you like purchasing batteries then this is the camera for you .
You cant even download all your pics onto the computer before the batteries die .
The pics dont even look good the quality is worse then my old 2 Mega pixel camera
unhhhhhh : Half baked , lazy , tired , &apos; phoning it in &apos;.
), PJ Harvey ( the band , but specifically Polly ) sure does exhaust its vocabulary on this record .
better than stories but disappointing overall .
embarrassing .
They were a sticky mess and not one bubble was catchable .
), this book is a classic example of everyting that &apos; s wrong with vanity presses .
Worst Book Ever : This is a review of the paperback version . The book presented in the LOOK INSIDE !
A difficult read .
STOP RIGHT HERE !
I am very unhappy with the product I received .
Paid $ 20 on it and they gave me $ 10 back and replied to my complaints with automated emails .
Not helpful .
The author shows a deep inner hatred of the United States and a deep hatred of Jews .
It &apos; s too bad this subject couldn &apos; t have been addressed in a more objective writing .
boring boring boring : I started to read this book and it lost my interest quick !
This is a really bad product .
This is a very dangerous product and i don &apos; t recommend it to anyone .
The third time I plugged in the AC adapter it failed to light up that it was getting power .
Absolutely pathetic quality on the AC adapter .
It was not much help to me .
DISAPPOINTING DVD : MGM Vintageclassic - NOT .
CAVEAT EMPTOR - you get what you pay for here - poor quality and spotty connections .
Enter evil P . A .
Her father is a pig , the man she marries is a pig ( hot , But a pig ) and she is such a wimp .
Though saying all this i think its Mef &apos; s lack of hunger that really lets this album down .
: this album is nominated by me for the worst thing that ever happened this year for music .
The lyrics seemed to be written by a four year old who is retarded .
Unfortunately , the Orinoco card I bought would never talk properly with the Linksys .
They spent the whole book arguing posintlessly about leaving each other .
Terrible .
It does not ring true and the people are boring .
boring , condescending and just plain irritating !!
This borrowed ( thank goodness ) book infuriated me and I didn &apos; t crack a smile once .
It is unfortunate however that she had to do at expense of all other parents .

Very upsetting .
Ugh & arrggh .
No theme , cut episodes , et cetera .
Really disappointing .
Poor quality recording .
When I contacted the seller she denied that the cd was used .
Two - dimensional characters , implausible plot ( how hard is it really to destroy an armoured TRAIN ?!!
WRONG .
Did they have a bad batch of timers ?
The villains seemed way too nice .
: Very disappointing collection of downtempo , blah , and loungy material .
I think Nora Roberts is a poor author .
Also , there are too many characters - which also confuses the story .
Why advocate such brutality ?
Very very weak .
It is the worst audiobook to which I &apos; ve listened !

INCREDIBLY disappointing .
disappointing .
She desperately needs killing off .
This was Cornwell &apos; s worst book .
I was totally disappointed in this book altogether .
: This has to be one of the worst PC books I &apos; ve read .
The characters have become shallow and caught up in personal problems that weigh down the book .
I am most disappointed in the way PC handled the whole plot of Wesley Benton .
Whatever personal problems you might be having .... leave them out of KS lives .
I have gotten tired of Lucy , tolerable of Kay at times , frustrated with Marino and adored Benton .
Really Disappointing !
It fails in that respect miserably .
Don &apos; t wasteyour time or money on Return of Dead 3 .
Major Disappointment .
How Richard Ben Cramer Lost : A very narrow minded and disappointing discussion .
The Fighting Agents - W . E . B . Griffin - UNABRIDGED AUDIO : Something is WRONG with this listing !!
&quot; Also the price is wrong for an unabridged book !
The actors are fake , their characters have turned unbelievable and the storyline dull .
people dead from malaria : People have died from malaria because of this book .
DDT could &apos; ve helped those in dire need .
Allerpet Let Me Down : It was a pain trying to put Allerpet C on my cats .
They hated me every time and promptly licked all of it off .
Not that great !
Does not work any better than the cheaper scraper that you can purchase from WalMart .
Not a good value : I &apos; ve owned this shredder for about a year .
The trap should have been 13 - 14 &quot; long to acommodate for the tail .
I am sorry to purchase a toy rather then a trap .
I waisted alot of nuts
: This guy is such a fake it &apos; s not even funny .
That &apos; s just desperate .
This guy &apos; s retarded . His music also sucks .
He should be paying royalties to Alice Cooper for every CD his clueless fans buy .

Disappointed to the Extreme : I cannot ereally rate the product , because I never recieved it .

Well , BIG DISAPPOINTMENT .
Then , it does not clean as good .
This thing blows more air than it sucks dirt .
What a useless thing .
Sorry , but I did not like the product what so ever .
It &apos; s never explained why the first murder even occurs .
Shame on Tom Clancy for allowing his name to be put on this worthless novel .
What a waste of money !
I was left with a real sense of having wasted my money .
Badly done , very boring , not informative at all .
Annoying bugs !
: This story was a little disappointing .
I can &apos; t say I enjoyed this book .
This makes it very difficult to place events in context .
boo : The Eagles are the most boring cliched band .
It &apos; s sickening .
I was VERY disappointed .
There seems to be a constant theme of anger and rejection throughout , that becomes exhausting .
I was SO incredibly disappointed with these earrings !
The image alone is deceiving .
There is virtually no bass at all ; and only after serious EQ tweaking does it sound even decent .
The problem is the straps , so much shorter than my other bras , which makes it very uncomfortable !
Warning : Do NOT read !
The reader must realize that at the time Moliere was penning this work , he was in debtor &apos; s prison .
Unfortunately , it is by far the worst navigation software ever devised .

Well , mine died too now .
Horrible : No redeeming qualities whatsoever .
The story is original , but weak and convoluted .
CGI for the death scenes ?
I hate to give a bad review , but people ranted and raved about this movie for a while .
I sought it out , but was left disapointed and irritated .
a mishmosh of alcoholism , child abuse , and immature adults : I was very much disappointed .
Fun but stupid : This film is set in the sixties in Cadiz , Spain .
The whores move in with them and rock their lives a bit .
The boys end up contracting a venereal disease and all hell breaks loose .
ONLY read it if you are forced to for school ... Why is this book considered a classic ?
Too bad she had to add this one to her resume .
What a waste of money !
Brad was his usual wooden , only appeals to adolescent females , boyish , hopeless self .
NO CONNECTION !
Not enough to save the movie .
An over the top boring bad guy .
They are both wasted on this turkey .
An amazingly stupid movie : The Mexican has to be the worst movie ive seen this year .
The screenwriter and director should br fired .
THIS MOVIE SUCKS AND ALL YOU LOSERS WHO GAVE IT 5 or 4 STARS SHOULD BE SHOT .
Dumb beyond words .
Terrible !
This is why the other person that rated this doesn &apos; t get good reception .
Reading it left me depressed , paranoid and angry .
Anything that is not her opinion is bad , evil , and wrong .
Her biased book has so much non - related informaiton that isn &apos; t even helpful .
HORRIBLE : Shouldn &apos; t pregnancy books be unbiased , truthful and scientific ?
I am horribly disappointed .

It also has no back - light , with limited instructions .
The Grateful Dead was his backup band .
disappointed : I purchased the 7 - pod AeroGarden approx .

It was really an awful book .

Here are 10 : 1 . They are ugly2 . They copied diva stars and bratz3 . They are BORING !!!
yeah ... but in all the wrong ways !
BAD HAIR !
When I took the doll out of the box her hair was a mess !
The doll is now on the floor totally ignored with messy hair !
Why bother releasing it ?
Highly disappointed with this product .
: These glasses were terribly disappointing .
The base is so unsteady that you feel uncomfortable about setting them down .
But Peach needs to bitch - slapped back to where the belong , making freaking documentaries !!
This one is really bad .
Mr . Williams completely lost me on his secret sauce in silver , which was using the full moon cycle .
Might be right , might be wrong , I just can &apos; t trade that and sleep at night , no pun intended .
A Misleading Threat to Depressed Patients Everywhere : Dr . Breggin never prescribes psychotropics .
He is less a Ralph Nader type , than a hate speech advocate against modern psychiatry .
Some do not , benefitting from other therapies .
The Book of the Trite : This book is awful !
The characters are ridiculous stereotypes from soap operas and cop shows .
Ancestors who lived on the brink of madness and genius ?
It &apos; s just really an awful , awful book .
The picture is wrong .
I &apos; m here to tell you , I am VERY VERY VERY disappointed .
Slow and boring : I did not know what to really expect from this book .
It was painfully slow and boring .
My Scene dolls suck .
My Scene dolls are slutty ugly dumb dolls .
Sad : I was looking forward to hearing these cds for some time ...
Unfortunatly as I read more of the book the more bored I got .
Horribly Written : I couldn &apos; t even get half way through it .
With too much dated , unnecessary and boring information .
Ludicrous plot .
Morally depraved garbage : Where do i start with this mindlessly pathetic film ?
Other films may be worse in this contest ( eg .
Only a sick set of minds would create such immoral garbage .
The movie is of course about greed , and there &apos; s a large amount of money at stake .
The rest of the compilation ranges from decent to &quot; What the hell is this ?&quot;
Gets really frustrating and repetitive even some will say it &apos; s not .
So if you &apos; re struggling just stop , wait ten seconds and then you &apos; ll be able to catch the leaders .
But seller refuse my return request due to the polices about no return under 4 carton .

the worst toy ever that has been made on earth !!!!
