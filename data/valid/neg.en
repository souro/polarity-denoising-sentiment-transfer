<n> Driller Killer : How horrible !
<n> They don &apos; t even fit in a pill cutter !
<n> It is incredibly painful when one gets stuck in my throat .
<n> My swallowing muscle contracts around it and it is awful .
<n> I even tried cutting one in half , but it is so fat that it still gets stuck .
<n> The vendor service was bad .
<n> I guess this book belongs in a quality library but I found it generally disappointing at the price .
<n> : So disappointed and will be returning this .
<n> No , this isn &apos; t a comedy .
<n> He tells two bogus tales of terror .

<n> It dragged -- the gags were infantile and not funny at all !
<n> What an appalling movie !
<n> Boring , moronic , and ( worst of all ), not funny .
<n> What a stupid movie !
<n> : This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen .
<n> I think that &apos; s a dumb idea .
<n> Cameron Diaz is pretty hot in this movie but the whole movie is just plain dumb .
<n> Stay far away from this movie it &apos; s dumb !
<n> The movie is a bore , and a waste of time .
<n> : I hate it when they don &apos; t create a Blu Ray with a proper master copy !
<n> Why the hell would they bother using a lower quality copy to create this ??!?!
<n> It &apos; s just plain lazy .
<n> This movie is painfull to watch , stupid , corny , and just plain not funny .
<n> Poor quality : I was greatly disappointed with this item .
<n> It totally ruins the book .

<n> Warning : does not cover Websphere 4 . 0 !
<n> Extremely bad for Art Historians !
<n> Gagged : I &apos; d say it was a book purposely written stupidly to appear clever .
<n> I found it extremely dull .
<n> I gagged out 1 / 2 way through it .
<n> I hate to say it but I was not too impressed .
<n> This viewpoint is just too cynical and cold for this reader .
<n> I very much doubt hat I will be reading any other of Vonnegut &apos; s works .
<n> The first one was so bad .
<n> Terrible Picture Quality : This DVD is so low in picture quality it is not worth purchasing .
<n> The video quality is horrible .
<n> I wasted my money and will go back to watching the DVD version .
<n> : Great movie ( as we all know ) but the BluRay edition if horrible .
<n> Shallow and boring !
<n> This book was a bit boring and predictable .
<n> I would not recommend !
<n> : This is the worst product as far as cool mist humidifiers go .
<n> I , too , thought it was missing a piece or I did something wrong .
<n> I want my money back from Time Warner : I just can &apos; t help believing !
<n> I think there must be something wrong with the production line .
<n> A waste of my [ money ].
<n> Really , how sad is that she is so easily manipulated .
<n> I enjoy sex scenes but I &apos; ll confess that I skipped a lot of them out of irritation .
<n> But that &apos; s usually not the case , and I wonder who would bother ?
<n> Poorly organized and the butterthlies is a terrible choice .
<n> There was no unique information here , or unique solutions to real - world problems .
<n> What a waste of time and money !
<n> Rydell Remastered : This was the worst CD that I ever purchased .
<n> I think if Bobby didn &apos; t hear it , he should , I think he would be embarrassed .
<n> I &apos; ve tried numerous lotions of theirs and Chocolate Indulgence is by far my least favorite .
<n> It &apos; s thicker than most and the smell is terrible !
<n> Sounds a little too much like a scam to me .
<n> Didn &apos; t really enjoy the film .
<n> This , however , is also it &apos; s weak point .
<n> Awful !
<n> &quot; Kill The Music &quot;, &quot; Bored Stiff &quot;, &quot; Pretty Dirty &quot;.
<n> not a good book to start with : if you start learning UML , this is absolutely not a good pick .
<n> The orgnization of this book is poor .
<n> The battery failed within a week after first usning it .
<n> Perhaps something else failed but the results were the same - - - in the garbage can !
<n> Awful product .
<n> I have no idea why its pretty simple and bad .
<n> ( It &apos; s so bad it will probably make you flinch .)
<n> However the quality of the movie was not impressive at all .
<n> TERRIBLE job , Warner Home Video !!
<n> Not really ...: I loved the princess bride .
<n> But , being the idiot that I am , I didn &apos; t look at the authors name .
<n> I think it absolutely ruins the story .
<n> The Princess Bride by William Goldman : I was very disappointed in this book .
<n> William Goldman totally ruined it for me .
<n> Additionally he gives a page of his ridiculous comments at the beginning of each chapter .
<n> He really ruined the story of the Princess Bride for me .
<n> If I bend my arm the sleeve chokes up all the way to my elbow !
<n> The storage case is pathetic .
<n> I &apos; d give the case a negative star , the saw is about a 2 star .
<n> This movie has one of the most dull endings I &apos; ve ever seen , it &apos; s just a really bad , BAD MOVIE !
<n> Lame : This movie drags on and on , leaving you depressed .
<n> I couldn &apos; t even finish watching it , I was so bored by 3 / 4 of the way through .
<n> Even the die hard Velvet Underground fans should be wary of this one .
<n> Disappointing !
<n> Just buying the single is a waste of money .
<n> worthless : I was very displeased with this book .
<n> For me this was a waste of time .
<n> Don &apos; t waste your time : Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read .
<n> How disappointed can a Book Club be ?
<n> Unfortunately , we all agreed that it is by far , the worst book any one of us has ever read .
<n> I &apos; m having a little trouble getting into this one .
<n> I think it &apos; s because I &apos; m just not quite ready for this particular style .
<n> Broke my kindle .
<n> Big mistake .
<n> It also showed an error and wouldn &apos; t open .
<n> When I tried a third book the error apeared again and the screen froze .
<n> Uncomfortable : I was disappointed with this purchase .
<n> Unfortunately I left it at a hotel and wanted a replacement .
<n> The additional height made this pillow very uncomfortable to say the least .
<n> Customer service : Hopkins EASYLIFT Tailgate EasyliftMy easylif broke after approx 11 months .
<n> Misleading material : I purchased this book after taking the 029 test .
<n> Mostly disappointing : This is a somewhat well written book .
<n> The plot is weak , however .
<n> : This is the most horrible Anime I &apos; v ever seen !
<n> It has an excellent cover but the story and drawings where worse than bad !
<n> The women Kimera , looks horrible !
<n> Bummer : Arrived with the thermometer broken off from base .
<n> 1 - it was incredibly low powered and 2 - there was no difference in power level from switch 4 to 5 .
<n> Other similar titles I like are Alfie , Californication , Fight Club , Choke , etc .
<n> Personally I was dissipointed that he did not get into idealistic reasons why some societies fail .
<n> He is chasing ghosts from an invented past and the writing suffers for it .
<n> Disappointing !
<n> I just don &apos; t like the hero Devil . Devil is the most stubborn donkey I have ever met !
<n> Not in as good condition as I expected but my fault for ordering a used book .
<n> The code examples also demonstrate poor programming practices .
<n> My expience tells me that Apple still doesn &apos; t play well with PC &apos; s .
<n> No customising !
<n> Disappointing !
<n> : This book was so disappointing !
<n> Unfortunately , it &apos; s all down hill from there folks .
<n> WE were unable to finish the book due to the book &apos; s lack of quality .
<n> A very disappointing read .
<n> The concept would probably be too taxing for his brain . Not a bad system .
<n> One of the VERY WORST !
<n> : This is one of the worst books I have ever read .
<n> Maybe it was the stupid / lame title , or maybe the boring plot .
<n> You know a movie isn &apos; t all that good when all that stands out are the looks of the main characters !
<n> Vampires , that &apos; s a laugh ... this movie has a terrible plot and the acting is even worse .
<n> The original &quot; Vampires &quot; sucked too , but this one is even worse folks !
<n> Especially if there is nothing else you would rather do than numb your mind .
<n> Not worthy of Pablo Montero .
<n> Of several dozen attempts to locate a term or item in the index , none were successful .
<n> However , after the first washing they shrunk quite a bit and the softness was lost .
<n> Big Fail : These leggings sit low on the waist , nothing like the pictures .
<n> Pathetic .
<n> very frustrating .
<n> I was wrong .
<n> When the backlight turns off the sound on the FM is drown out by an annoying hum .
<n> Sadly disappointing becasue it seems this is the same on all this model not just the one I had .
<n> I was very unhappy : What can I say .
<n> I purchased not once but twice and not because I liked it .
<n> : This has to be the all time worst sci - fi flick since the mesozoic era .
<n> Poor acting .
<n> Poor directing .
<n> Poor scenery and effects ...
<n> ( thats unacceptable to me ) I was disappointed with this purchase .
<n> The book on the whole is not the pleasure to read that his two previous works were .
<n> TOO many words , unknown words , Agatha gone mad .
<n> &quot; Read The Lizard &apos; s Tail by Valenzuela or Ship of Fools by Peri Rossi instead .
<n> Junk : Mine was dead out of the box .
<n> Poor villains .
<n> Poor effects .
<n> As I started to read it though , I felt as though it were extremely boring .
<n> Disappointing : From the advertisement , we thought we were buying a lot of stickers .
<n> It was very disappointing ; the stickers are way overpriced for the quantity included .
<n> My biggest disappointment is that it does not include the reworked Raymond Burr version .
<n> After reading through it and using some of the code samples , I found they were terribly written .
<n> If this is dead wrong , who knows what else in there is ??
<n> This guy gives servlets a bad name ... where are the other servlet books ?
<n> disappointing and overpriced : This 14 . 95 PAMPHLET is totally overpriced .
<n> Also irritating is the fact that its not worth 14 . 95 !
<n> Horrible Printing : The printing in this book is the smallest I have ever seen - almost unreadable .
<n> Also the book has hundreds of spelling mistakes .
<n> The producers of this book should be ashamed of themselves .
<n> It is full of typos , omitted words and wrong words , which makes it very hard to read .
<n> The typesetting is also of very low quality , which also makes it hard to read .
<n> It it doubtful that it was even run through a spell - check program .
<n> Sadly I was disappointed I actually wanted this book to be good .
<n> I had to go to the WC half way through the movie , even without sound it looked boring .
<n> However , I received a defective DVD which made the middle third of the movie unviewable .
<n> It is possibly the most boring movie I have ever seen .
<n> Damaged DVD : This DVD was damaged and I was not able to view it .
<n> Beautiful But Boring : England is at war with France .
<n> First it was a Moby Dick movie , then it was something else , then back to Moby Dick again .
<n> Yuck : Worst Russell Crowe movie I ever saw and I really like Russell Crowe .
<n> The movie was very boring in my opinion .
<n> waste of time ......: I wanted so bad to like this movie , but unfortunately I could not .
<n> I had a hard time understanding the dialog so I was forced to use the english subtitles .
<n> There &apos; s almost zero action in this movie and even the one battle scene was weak .
<n> Very , very boring movie .
<n> I &apos; m sorry guys but this one sucks bad ... Real Bad !.......
<n> It uses a more realistic example and shows the error handling in more detail .
<n> Boy , was I disappointed !
<n> This album is REALLY disappointing and shows the weak ( est ?)
<n> Damn , this one was way too boring .
<n> : Ya thought What &apos; s the story was a stupid cd , think again .
<n> This cd takes the cake as the most stupid cd this year has released .
<n> I hate Oasis and it &apos; s arrogance .
<n> I hate every cd they &apos; ve ever released .
<n> Buy the single , but leave the album alone .
<n> Boring Movie : What a disappointment this movie was .
<n> It had really good actors but it was slow , uninteresting , and just a waste of time .
<n> The F bomb is dropped including ,&quot; Jesus F &apos; ing Christ .&quot;
<n> This is unacceptable .
<n> What torture .
<n> Horrible movie with disfunctional characters that behave like fools .
<n> Helen &apos; s more believable with Colin Firth but her role makes her out to be an idiot .
<n> There &apos; s nothing interesting about this movie , not even the setting .
<n> Nothing like the book !
<n> Manson is still a legend ... but this whole concept is his least interesting album to date .
<n> Awful : This book is horrible .
<n> Hair : Its Power and Meaning ....: An awful atrocity of the literary genre .
<n> I did not enjoy it .
<n> Boy , was I disappointed .
<n> This book was a mostly a waste of time .
<n> I am very disappointed in it .
<n> Lord of Chaos , along with the preceding two books , suddenly began to drag .
<n> I had originally thought that this series was going to end at 8 books , but now I &apos; m not so sure .
<n> This book is complicate and ugly : This book starts with &quot; What is PL / SQL ?&quot;.
<n> However , I do not feel reading this book alone can get me anywhere but waste all my time .
<n> author waste pages on style which is useless to experienced programmers .
<n> waste of money
<n> After reading this book I was very discouraged from using ATL .
<n> Inside COM , by Rogerson , puts Inside ATL to shame .
<n> Boy was I wrong .
<n> One of the least useful I &apos; ve encountered !
<n> : I find this set to be next to useless .
<n> This was the only ELP CD that I did not yet own because I was scared to buy it .
<n> Now that I have purchased it I am at a loss for words . This is not the ELP that I remember .
<n> It has a rushed feel and there is nothing impressive here . I am sorry .
<n> I think Wrox should be ashamed of themselves .
<n> I did want to get to the end of the story but I became impatient with the middle .
<n> I can see how someone could see the &quot; deeper message ,&quot; but the book was boring .
<n> And for 400 pages , it is almost a waste of time .
<n> However , this DVD set is poor quality and not recommended .
<n> Waste of paper .
<n> waste of plastic , and a waste of paper .
<n> I am very upset with Canon and its short - lived circuitry .
<n> Printer would not get past the set up returning an error about the &quot; scan lock &quot;.
<n> Numerous mistakes throughout the book including in the review questions .
<n> Not a well written book : Book is one of the most boring I have ever tried to read .
<n> I read many travel books but this one is awful .
<n> The book wanders all over the place - no details at all - or none of any consequence !
<n> Heavy Paperweight : This book starts strong , then becomes a sad use of dead trees .
<n> Well I found out exactly how bad .
<n> Some of the information is just plain wrong , whilst other parts simply are badly explained .
<n> If your company is starting to try to avoid microsoft products as ours is , STAY AWAY !
<n> WORST book I have come across in a LONG time ....: This is a seriously awful book .
<n> SHAME SHAME SHAME on everyone involved in this terrible book .
<n> Useless : An absolutely useless source for information on xml .
<n> The examples were not clear or useful , and the writing was too pretentious to read .
<n> : One of the strangest books I have seen and a very disturbing trend .
<n> Its bad enough to get ads at movie theaters and on rental videos , but in a technical book ?
<n> &quot; Total waste of money !
<n> P . Jones remains straight during the whole film .- The coming out moment is so fake .
<n> Complete waste of money !!!
<n> They are well - written and were ground - breaking 150 years ago , but they do not age well .
<n> It is as bad as listening to an old cassette tape .
<n> Well , they were right but for the wrong reason .
<n> Recipes lack imagination : Nothing different about recipes .
<n> Not as good smelling as I thought .
<n> Think I ordered the wrong Mont Blanc fragrance .
<n> Overall I found the book very uninspired and was disappointed by it .
<n> : This is a terrible single for a decent , catchy song .
<n> : Worse than a merely bad film is a self - important bad film .
<n> It was ridiculous .
<n> The two actors were really cheesy and stupid .
<n> This was a disappointment : I found this book to be a disappointment .
<n> Very disappointed .
<n> The acting is poor .
<n> I feel if you do not have an interesting story to tell why try .
<n> What a waste of my time .
<n> How disappointing .
<n> Awful , twice over !
<n> I found this movie to be big time boring .
<n> gone with the wind : This sucked because it arrived with only one dvd in it , it should of had two .
<n> I wanted to return it but my printer is dead so I couldn &apos; t print the return so I wasted my money .
<n> These books are terrible !
<n> I &apos; ve read almost every book published on touring and this thing is the worst hands down .
<n> I don &apos; t think I &apos; ve ever had a more visceral dislike of a book than I experienced toward this one .
<n> I found the book dull and unsatisfying .
<n> I found the book dull and unsatisfying .
<n> The sound on this thing is horrific .
<n> The more they mess with this album .
<n> the worse it sounds .
<n> I did NOT get mine here , so cold have been a bad run ??
<n> Jim Croce died WAY too young .
<n> Horrible text : My daughter uses this series for sixth grade Social Studies .
<n> I think it is among the worse textbooks I have ever seen .
<n> Very bad quality !!!
<n> : Sigma watch has a very poor quality .
<n> It &apos; s * not * that I believe in coddling and sheltering children from the harsh realities of life .
<n> The problem appeared to be with the power cord itself .
<n> Poor Quality : I don &apos; t recommend this microwave .
<n> HORRIBLE !!!
<n> Then I took them out for smallmouths a few weeks later and I found the leak .
<n> So I had to spend the rest of the week in leaky falling down pieces of crap !
<n> I would never recommend this to anyone !
<n> It is just a horrible product .
<n> I was so dissatisfied with this do not buy it .
<n> Waste of money : These waders only lasted three outings .
<n> USB connection in tablet fails .
<n> However after a couple of months it started failing .
<n> As other posters have noted , Trudeau unfortunately changed the design of the lid for the worse .
<n> Disappointed : When I try to drink from the cup very little of the liquid comes out .
<n> I like the design etc but the lid is not good for drinking from .
<n> The reviews are for the wrong performance !
<n> Only symbols and images , no concepts !
<n> I personally found this a bit boring .
<n> it stopped working accurately !!!
<n> a real piece of junk : This is the worst mop I have ever owned !
<n> I contacted the manufacturer and the replacement mop they provided is just as bad .
<n> The replacement is not cellulose sponge and does not clean the floor .
<n> Worst mop ever !
<n> SUCKS !
<n> : This product sucks .
<n> I was extremely disappointed
<n> Constant attempts at humor make for twitching and disgust .
<n> The book is written by a dummy for dummies or more aptly by a moron for morons .
<n> If we stop going , they will stop making them .
<n> Jackson &apos; s Kong was worse than the 70 &apos; s remake of Kong .
<n> Much worse .
<n> Most people in this country don &apos; t have health care .
<n> But they waste millions of dollars on crap films like this .
<n> Ban all remakes .
<n> But a terriable movie : BORING .
<n> It stars Jack Black , which automatically makes it bad .
<n> You know bad guys smashed or something .
<n> Over - Rated , Cheesy , Boring , Corny , OVER - RATED !
<n> Did the bugs decide to ignore him ?
<n> Highly scholastic work does not need to be difficult to read .
<n> Terrible transfer : bad color alignment and often audio sync issues .
<n> I also had some trouble with the audio sync .
<n> Big disappointment .
<n> The critics are right -- this movie isn &apos; t very good .
<n> Aside from all that , a real depressing movie .
<n> DULL , SLOW AND DULL : Good premise but slow snail pace slow and dull .
<n> The acting is stiff and uncomfortable .
<n> Tailgate Grill - FAIL !!!
<n> The second nightlight worked properly , but a 50 % faulty rate is unacceptable .
<n> The source code examples in the CD are next to useless .
<n> I have no difficulty running lots of games at high resolution .
<n> I was bitterly disappointed that after one cycle in the dishwasher , the top malfunctioned .
<n> BAD PRODUCT DO NOT BUY
<n> By the next summer the legs started getting weak .
<n> I took apart the heating element and was aghast at what I saw .
<n> It was a good product two years ago but the 2009 and later components are defective and cheap .
<n> Electric is nice , but some major problems : I &apos; ve had two of these grills .
<n> The second grill has melted around the heating element , which seems to be a fire hazard .
<n> The new unit worked once , and then failed completely .
<n> lousy design ...: I am now on my 3rd Char - Broil patio caddie !
<n> Disappointing : This author in no Dennis Smith .
<n> &quot;, before he kills it .
<n> There &apos; s more but I prefer to just forget the whole regretable experience .
<n> Disappointing : I read a lot of thrillers , and this debut by Casey Moreton disappointed me .
<n> The shipping suck .
<n> It &apos; s totally bad quality differ from what the seller detail .
<n> Bad Service , bad product .
<n> So much for consumer protection and refunds for defective products .
<n> Do not buy ANYTHING from this company , especially this product , unless you want to lose your money .
<n> Imac Crap : This book is useless .
<n> : a spaghetti western at its worst .
<n> Mistook the film for the new Django and what a mistake it was .
<n> I don &apos; t love it .
<n> DO NOT BUY THIS , you will be disappointed .
<n> I find it in very bad taste to use profanity in front of children .
<n> Garbage : Poor acting all around , Horrible storyline .
<n> This is a waste of money : This CD set was a complete letdown .
<n> BORING !
<n> The illustrations are CHEESY . The photographs are of poor quality , you can barely discern them .
<n> The information is general , contradictory , unorganized ...
<n> If your info is poor then your fruit will suffer .
<n> Not only did this trap not catch any flies , the smell was dreadful .
<n> At first we thought we had a dead mouse in the wall .
<n> The smell is that bad .
<n> This trap was a waste of money and time .
<n> Yes . Have practically any flies been caught by this stupifyingly piece of useless rubbish ?
<n> OUTRAGEOUS price !
<n> One of the worst movies of the decade .
<n> terrible : Why did I waste my time watching this movie ?
<n> It was beyond bad .
<n> : This was a total waste of time .
<n> Bad acting , worse plot , the most intelligent part is the screams of OMG .
<n> Skip this movie , it is the worst I &apos; ve seen in my life .
<n> I must admit I was highly disappointed .
<n> Repressive husband , wife gets tired of it and starts to look for more .
<n> I didn &apos; t care for the lines or the chemistry between the cast .
<n> Poor anti - war movie : I am trying to decide if I am going to throw this DVD away .
<n> I did not get any helpful info from this book along these lines .
<n> Not really that great .
<n> Not as effective as had hoped ... and it REEKS !!!!!
<n> The odor from the trap is absolutely horrific and unbearable .
<n> Plain old Boring !
<n> It just was not funny .
<n> A waste of talent : This movie has an all star cast but is so horrid .
<n> : This group is so WEAK I could puke !
<n> &quot; I think they lost their balls &quot;: This whiny pop punk ass bull sucks !
<n> If you want to listen to real punk rock get a Dead kennedys , rancid , bad religon or sex pistols cd !
<n> : Now i decided to review this rancid cd , i mean green day cd , o wait is it blink 182 ?
<n> so sad it really is .
<n> ! What qualifies for music these days is just horrible .
<n> These guys have NO punk essense whatever .
<n> Don &apos; t support this trash .
<n> No balls ... no helmets ... just pads !
<n> I hate posers , and i am tired of rippin off the Casualties and other true punk bands .
<n> The lead singer is not very good , and his voice may grate on your nerves .
<n> Killing Rock and Roll : Many analogies fly , comparing Simple Plan to actual musicians .
<n> no pads , no helmets ........ just [ bad ]!
<n> Worst thing I ever did .
<n> The singer is really whiney .
<n> I HATE WANNABES !!!!!
<n> : i absulootly h @ wanabes they make me sick !
<n> Why does punk rock suck so bad now ?
<n> Let them have a taste of the rock star life style , but in a year they will be forgotten .
<n> They have to be the worst band ever .
<n> This band doesn &apos; t , and it sounds terrible . Singing : The lead singers voice is absolutely horrifying .
<n> But needless to say , nothing special . I won &apos; t even mention how awful their image is .
<n> also the ankle braces are cheesy and uncomfortable .
<n> Put in a AAA battery , start it up , take one photo , and the battery is dead .
<n> But it doesn &apos; t tell you the battery is dead , so you keep taking pictures , but they don &apos; t get saved .
<n> This or 2001 : A Space Oddesy . The film is made longer , but not much so , ( Even more BORING !
<n> Very disappointing .
<n> Rescue My Wallet : Useless , a total waste of money .
<n> Mostly though the quality control in these DVD &apos; s is realy bad .
<n> The characters are poorly drawn , swaggering fools , and the Cylons are even worse .
<n> They &apos; re slow - moving , dullards of machines .
<n> Disappointed : I bought this set to have some extra sockets around the house .
<n> TERRIBLE !
<n> Avoid this one !
<n> However , upon first use , the yellow handled driver broke .
<n> Yet I found it to be of inferior quality .
<n> The ratchet looks like die cast metal even though it is &quot; triple chrome plated .&quot;
<n> not even able take off one nut before it broke .
<n> The blow molded case is a disaster - nothing fits in its place .
<n> : Thomas M . Thomas and his co - authors did a very poor job this time .
<n> Disappointed child and mama !
<n> My son likes looking at the video box but doesn &apos; t enjoy the video at all .
<n> NOT the BEST from the BEST : The waffle maker and sandwich maker USED TO work great .
<n> ( I never had the opportunity to use the pizzelle part .)
<n> Everyone in the family , including the kids , hated the BAM !
<n> This has got to be the worst batman movie ever .
<n> : Batman Returns is just plain sick at times .
<n> is blond ( she is supposed to be raven haired ) and more of a pain to watch then anything else .
<n> : Tim Burton &apos; s worst movie , hands down .
<n> : This movie is disgusting .
<n> Unfortunately , I do not find myself among them .
<n> The acting wasn &apos; t all that great and neither was the story line .
<n> A horribly written and edited book about the queen of rock .
<n> Back Care Yoga A Waste of Money : I was really disappointed by this DVD .
<n> It looks like the book was rushed out to capitalize on the war and Rumsfeld media attention .
<n> Pointless : What a waste of money !
<n> disappointing : I was expecting so much more after _ Dawn and this book wasa disappointment .
<n> They came defective .
<n> It looked like a crease in the picture or a depression made from to much pressure .
<n> How Steinbeck could say soooooooo much about soooooooo little makes my head hurt .
<n> torture !!
<n> If you follow his advice and the IRS prosecutes , you will lose .
<n> : i think that the show is dumb and that buffy in the movie is a senior !
<n> I guess they were bought out and the qualityis not so great .
<n> So they are useless .
<n> I &apos; m no longer jealous .
<n> The story is trite , confused , slow , and stereotypical .
<n> The editor should be immediately fired for letting this into the market .
<n> Very frustrating and disappointing .
<n> what a piece of waste !
<n> Readnig bad attempts at humor are much worse than reading a technical book that is dry .
<n> Assembly is a bit tricky : Disappointed that I found it impossible to assemble the stands .
<n> This is why it makes me so sad to see such a barebones release .
<n> This DVD has absolutely no extras ( well , it does have a chapter selection ?).
<n> BIG MISTAKE !
<n> I am a longtime fan of Daniela and her band , but this one disappointed on first few listens .
<n> Big mistake .
<n> The handle and mop head parted ways on the first use and refused to be reunited !
<n> This was a waste of money and time .
<n> Painful to watch in so many ways .
<n> If only there was something more than shock and bland dialogue !
<n> McDowell tells Louis about the story of Dorian Gray and how he made a pact with the devil .
<n> Unspeakably boring for a while , then it gets a shot of something and then it goes into a coma .
<n> It only took me 2 hours to read the whole book and to find out that it is a bad book .
<n> This Chair is bad : It would not support 100lbs .
<n> Piss poor unoriginal mallcore : Don &apos; t waste your time buying this garbage .
<n> These guys suck and I have no idea why the hell they are touring with Megadeth .
<n> They should have gotten Municipal Waste to open up .
<n> I was wrong !
<n> : poor craftship when it came to the stitching .
<n> It never arrived : I paid for it , i need it next week , i &apos; ve filed a claim , but still no book ?
<n> Horror is diseased .
<n> We will no longer get real horror .
<n> The first was scary , the rest [ stink ]!
<n> Dwarf Cichlids by david Boruchowiztz : I was very disappointed by this book .
<n> A Bad Bad christmas album .
<n> : This album is so cheesy , it makes me wnat to puke and swallow my own intestines .
<n> Sappy , childish , commercial ...: ... no depth at all in this CD .
<n> Ridiculous CD .
<n> The makeup is terrible , the acting is mediocre , plot ?
<n> The zombie action is boring .
<n> Extremely Disappointing !
<n> &quot; Cemetery Man &quot; is simply BORING , that &apos; s right it BORING !
<n> Terrible movie : This was a total waste of 90 minutes of my life .
<n> Terrible , boring , stupid , and senseless don &apos; t begin to describe this waste of film .
<n> I watch horror , slasher , foreign and suspense films all the time .
<n> Cemetary Man : Italians are good at Gore , but fail at plot .
<n> This is only different in having a smaller budget , smaller plot , and equally bad acting .
<n> Anyway , I &apos; m not saying that all Helloween albuns after Michael Weikath took control are horrible .
<n> Didn &apos; t much care for it .
<n> : Um , can you say one of the worst movies ever ?
<n> The only man that fell here was me .. falling for the price of renting this horrible movie !
<n> Lifeless , dreary , and humorless .
<n> Fast forward to he meets up with another loser ( Hutton ), and his loser shop - lifting wife ( Stone ).
<n> Stone looks yucky .
<n> Maybe it was the awful acting .
<n> Is Freddy dead yet ?
<n> sucked !!!
<n> : this one just stunk overall there is no dought about that .
<n> 0 STARS : AWFUL !!
<n> That is the basis for policy and has established the seriousness of many environmental problems .
<n> This demonstrates its lack of balance .
<n> This book contains errors and distortions .
<n> Unfortunately , the reviewers just add to the confusion .
<n> China has been lying about their catches for years .
<n> 90 % of all statistics can be used to show either side of the argument 50 % of the time !
<n> READ WITH SKEPTICISM !
<n> Sadly these songs can still be heard in elevators and dentist offices across America .
<n> Even sadder is that people will pay to hear them again at home .
<n> Even for American standarts this should cause a big scandal !
<n> Absolutely horrible : Absolutely horrible .
<n> The acting is absolutely horrible .
<n> Email me if you disagree .
<n> Of course , in conquering her fears she saves his life , blah , blah , blah .
<n> What a waste of money .
<n> : Note the worst book in the world , but fairly darn close .
<n> It &apos; s not good enough to have a good ides , you have to write well , too .
<n> 1984 was much more enjoyable ...: A decent book , but compared to 1984 , this book was not that good .
<n> The line between protagonist and antagonist seemed blurred throughout this book until the end .
<n> I actually failed to finish this book , I found it so terribly dry and unenlightening .
<n> Sometimes they make tentative suggestions that this - may - work - then , but never many good examples .
<n> Therefore highlighting specific elements of a website out of context is meaningless .
<n> Waste if time ; waste of money : I should start by saying I didn &apos; t read the whole book .
<n> It was maddening to have the beginning of every chapter fractured with this conjecture .
<n> I considered this a total waste of money .
<n> It &apos; s sad .
<n> Not easy to dance to : I was so disappointed with this dance video !
<n> It is so confusing and not fun at all .
<n> Big disappointment .
<n> Only the obvious copied and pasted : This book I found rather disappointing .
<n> disappointed : I was extremely disappointed and caught very off guard by this book .
<n> Nightmare on Elm Street 5 : The Dream Child : The second to worst film in the series .
<n> Not that good .
<n> Kind of boring with hardly any death scenes or comedy .
<n> But this time , Alice is pregnant with a boy and Freddy is using her unborn son to haunt her .
<n> Followed by Freddy &apos; s Dead : The Final Nightmare .
<n> who could expect anything from this mess ?
<n> No one should expect anything but boredom from this .
<n> Add us to the negative list .
<n> Maddening .
<n> All in all a rather frustrating and meaningless movie after the suspense in the beginning .
<n> Damaged goods ... Pay attention to vendor name .
<n> : The item was damaged , and previously a returned item .
<n> The vendor is less than scrupleous to send defective items ... fool me once ... never again !
<n> Spanky , Buckwheat and the gang were badly served by MGM &apos; s joyless , heavy - handed approach .
<n> We &apos; re talking Spanky and Company at their worst !
<n> This is what killed my ear for music .
<n> I HATE THIS CD AND STILL HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST MY MOM FOR MAKING ME LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE !
<n> The most BORING book in the world !
<n> It is the worst book in the world , and it drags on and on and on .
<n> Pure crap .
<n> Unfortunately I was unable to watch the film due to bad quality of the picture .
<n> Even worse , the camera wasn &apos; t focused properly and the white balance must have been way off .
<n> Problem is I bought this online so I had no idea .
<n> I was very disappointed .
<n> NOT RECOMMAND ...: TOTALLY DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION , TERRIBLE ASSEMBLING ...
<n> Horrible Formatting : This book has THE WORST formatting I &apos; ve ever seen .
<n> This all means that you only see a very tiny area , which makes using it a real pain .
<n> I &apos; m disappointed and saddened .
<n> Can a book be any duller ?
<n> Debra Messing is the only salvation in the show , but she &apos; s not enough to save bad comedy .
<n> I was disappointed in my purchase . DPrice
<n> James Mason was horribly miscast as Norman Maine as were almost all the other characters .
<n> the slats are weak and my husband snapped one while assembling it .
<n> and worst of all , it is increadibly squeaky , and is getting worse .
<n> another disappointment !
<n> This movie is VERY LONG , VERY SLOW , BORING , with a very disappointing ending .
<n> Boring !
<n> I &apos; ve been on this book for over a week and have absolutely no problem putting it down .
<n> This book talks a lot and gives ideas but fails to properly explain the code or the objects .
<n> I thought that this would be the perfect book for my needs but I have never been so wrong .
<n> Faulty Information ?
<n> Rethink before you buy : It is in no way the bedding that I don &apos; t like .
<n> DLInk customer services was not one bit helpful .
<n> Poor quality : Very poor recording .
<n> piece of crap : d - link needs to get its act together .
<n> never seen so much problems from one equipment .
<n> dlink sucks : i am so disappointed because tech support was unhelpful .
<n> they could not get my laptap wireless running they blamed on my laptap .
<n> Waste of money - no range : From the word go , this router has been painful .
<n> Connection Problems - cannot use all features : I have had this router for over a year .
<n> I returned it and got the next one with the same problem .
<n> Not so funny : Just got through watching this .
<n> The jokes are cruder , less funny , and they just keep on beating on the same thing again and again .
<n> I was disappointed in this release .
<n> Awful !
<n> In a word : Terrible .
<n> Unfortunatly , I was wrong .
<n> You know how powerful it was in its heydey , but all you can see now is a sick , mottled mess .
<n> terrible , even at a low price : I bought these clippers for cutting hair at home .
<n> I was extremely disappointed in it .
<n> : I &apos; ve been very disappointed with this since we got it .
<n> Everything in the kit feels cheap . Too bad we held onto this past the 30 day return policy .
<n> A waste of talent : This movie was probably the biggest bomb of 1994 .
<n> I honestly feel that this is one of the worst if not &quot; THE &quot; worst movie ever made .
<n> This was even worse than &quot; Ishtar &quot; folks .
<n> I don &apos; t have any desire to see this again , and I won &apos; t own it either .
<n> Where I couldn &apos; t put the other Ender books down , I had to really struggle to finish this one .
<n> Character interaction is there , sure , but it seems dull and plodding .
<n> The charecterization sucks and the plot * feels * manufactured .
<n> There were too many miracles , too many near deaths , too many almost destructions .
<n> I didn &apos; t get &quot; it &quot;: I like Adam Sandler , but I didn &apos; t like or &quot; get &quot; this movie &apos; s point at all .
<n> This movie is disturbing at times and confusing at others .
<n> This was an awful movie .
<n> Boring dialog , uninteresting characters , painfully slow pacing .
<n> This is the worst of the big 3 but they are all highly overrated .
<n> Worst Movie I &apos; ve Ever Seen : I &apos; ve seens some bad movies in my day , but this one takes the cake .
<n> Then , many of the other scenes have painful background music that drags on and on .
<n> Further , the cinematography is horrible .
<n> Not Worth Watching - spoilers -: This movie is a bore !
<n> Acting is great . The constant music through - out the movie was just annoying .
<n> The camera angles and shadow shots were just irritating .
<n> What a waste of my time and money !
<n> Wrong .
<n> This move is as disturbing as it is sad .
<n> The violence is not enjoyable .
<n> It was nothing like the trailers portrayed it to be and I will not recommend it to anyone .
<n> punch drunk love : This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen .
<n> No plot , No real story to the characters .
<n> After receiving this aluminum handled Hula Hoe it broke after two weeks .
<n> This makes it very weak .
<n> Worst receiver I have ever bought : Mine lasted all of 2 years and now it has stopped working .
<n> So so acting and not so good effects .
<n> Overall , this movie made my brain go numb .
<n> Awful : Spend your money for some other DVD .
<n> Really Sad !
<n> The rest of the album is boring and unexciting .
<n> A little catchy , pretty disappointing : It &apos; s more grown up than her previous albums in bad way .
<n> For that reason alone , I can &apos; t see myself purchasing her cd despite her talent in music .
<n> He &apos; d imagined a number to set up a battle .
<n> Very Disappointed !
<n> Well , I just got it in the mail and am extremely disappointed with the information .
<n> If you &apos; re not , save your time and money .
<n> Horrible : I hated this .
<n> Unfortunately , this disk from Movie Mars will not play on my dvd player .
<n> I have ordered many dvds from Amazon and have never had this problem .
<n> Awful Fake Compilation BEWARE !
<n> Very misleading .
<n> Does not fit !
<n> If one is looking for sheer disappointment , have at it .
<n> I think it is not good for a child .
<n> I threw his 2 books on the end times in the trash can so no one would be miss lead by them .
<n> Time has been cruel to the Pastor &apos; s prognostications .
<n> I was disappointed .
<n> When I removed the offending unit the freezes were gone as well .
<n> Additionally , the installation manual had erroneous information in it .
<n> Sadly , this film is an unbroken string of cliche laden dialogue , actions and plot lines .
<n> It &apos; s bad enough to get their undivided attention .
<n> The plot is as difficult to follow as it is thin .
<n> It is painful to watch this film , if you can even call it that .
<n> The dialogue in this movie is where this movie gets hurt very badly .
<n> Quite possibly the worst movie I &apos; ve ever seen : I have attempted to watch this movie twice .
<n> Perhaps it gets better , but when over half of the movie is dead , I don &apos; t see how it could .
<n> Might be the only one but I hated it .
<n> i rented it and proceeded to utterly waste two hours of my life .
<n> this movie is pathetic .
<n> The worst mistake he ever made was agreeing to make this movie .
<n> This is horrible : I &apos; m sorry , there is something very sick about this CD .
<n> I tried as hard as I could not to laugh at this , but .... I &apos; m afraid it &apos; s impossible
<n> Thats pathetic !
<n> Perhaps , if the storyline of the book were my life , it would depress me very much .
<n> I did not enjoy this book at all .
<n> Wharton was an unhappy woman , and while reading her book , I was unhappy as well .
<n> AWFUL , BORING , DONT READ !
<n> The WORST book in the history of ink !!!
<n> If you are unhappy in a marriage you &apos; d get a divorce .
<n> This is one book that actually DISCOURAGES people from reading .
<n> A pity ; they &apos; ll miss out on Wharton &apos; s lucid and luminous prose .
<n> But for today &apos; s reader , it &apos; s a dull , dry book .
<n> How BORING !
<n> Much as I hate to leave a book unfinished , this isn &apos; t just worth my time and effort .
<n> I picked this up thinking it was de Palmas Dahlia - what a complete waste of time ...
<n> Please don &apos; t encourage this guy to make any more movies ... seriously , it was awful .
<n> Wrong .
<n> Just avoid this movie it is really awful .
<n> It ` s a rainy , obscure night , and suddently people start getting murdered for no apparent reason .
<n> Lame Hitchcock Ripoff Wannabe : Even John Cusack can &apos; t save this .
<n> The director and writers tried to imitate Hitchcock &apos; s brilliance and failed miserably .
<n> Even she couldn &apos; t rescue it .
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> Because there were a lot of mistakes in this book , the more I read the madder I got .
<n> I take that back the meaning of this book showed me that she was DUMB & STUPID AS HELL .
<n> Big Disappointment : Nice gimmick , but lousy story .
<n> TV &apos; s Seinfeld did a riff on Betrayal with the Indian Wedding episode .
<n> As for the story , I found it boring .
<n> Yet another revenge story , HO HUM .
<n> The hours ....: What an awful , awful movie !
<n> Flitting through 3 lives , we discover 3 miserable people .
<n> No reason for this movie but to waste an hour and a half .
<n> All I will say is that I wasted an hour of my life on watching it in theaters .
<n> This movie is short , dull , boring , and its about deeply trouble lesbians .
<n> The critics out there must be crazy !
<n> It shocks me to hear that this dull movie has actually been nominated for nine Academy Awards !
<n> This movie is terrible .
<n> Only because there is no 0 - star ranking : This movie is absolutely dreadful .
<n> Just awful .
<n> Unfortunately the movie turned out to be a maelstrom of depression feeding on depression .
<n> No DVD should be released without the original aspect ratio .
<n> Plastic covering had cuts in it and the paper cover was cut and very scuffed .
<n> Very poor piece of work : I bought this CD to listen to the sound or rain and thunderstorms .
<n> I only give it 1 star because that &apos; s the lowest you can go !
<n> I guess I assumed wrong .
<n> Too bad -- be forewarned .
<n> I did not laugh once .
<n> i really hate this film .
<n> This one is hopelessly mediocre and it dates really badly .
<n> The gender roles are so boring - the man who is dark and cynical ( his name is BURNS - how profound !
<n> This is hollywood fantasy at its worst .
<n> Usually I &apos; m more eloquent than that , but ... wow ... this was bad .
<n> A guy getting stabbed by corn .
<n> It hurt my &quot; head &quot; to try and stay with it .
<n> much to my dismay , the music no more than &quot; sorta pretty &quot;.
<n> Looks bad when not covered by a tree skirt , but it works !
<n> 4 ) Clay Aiken puts this guy to shame .
<n> 5 ) His pretty - boy face , not that pretty .
<n> 6 ) The CD consists of thoughtless effortless jargon babbled with the intention of making money .
<n> 7 ) This album is awful .
<n> Horrible Attempt at Music : If you &apos; re a delusional fan of &apos; Bachelor Bob &apos;, it rocks !!!
<n> I would call him more of a poor man &apos; s combo of Toad the Wet Sproket and the Gin Blossoms .
<n> fake : if i were all of u wanting to buy this cd , i wouldnt .
<n> I tried to get into my account , but have forgotten my password .
<n> The gas regulator had leak by when set to zero .
<n> Tired of messing with it went to welding supplier and bought new .
<n> comfortable but with problems !
<n> This used to be a great series , but the last 4 or 5 have been a major disappointment .
<n> not worth the 2 for 11 dollars bin at wal - mart , just junk !!!!!!!
<n> This movie I guess was trying to be a comedy , but was not funny at all .
<n> Just a waste of time in general to watch this .
<n> Bullock boring .
<n> BORING : This film was just stupid .
<n> The film tries to show the womens &apos; enduring friendship , but it is all ... dull and contrived .
<n> This , along with Basie with strings , are among the very very few lousy Count Basie albums .
<n> Pablo should be ashamed for releasing it .
<n> Poor quality bottle : Be prepared to replace the weak plastic bottle within a year .
<n> Depicted wrong : Not what I expected .
<n> With this a lot of dirt and junk gets back into the water jug .
<n> : The photo is deceiving .
<n> : If I could rate this lower than one star , I would !
<n> I was on hold for 45 minutes and then I lost patience .
<n> Also , his style was hopelessly outdated by 1968 .
<n> I don &apos; t know what it was , it was just boring .
<n> rant , it &apos; s old .
<n> Battle of the Scrawny Suitors .
<n> I don &apos; t care how good the book is or isn &apos; t , free list should be free .
<n> Equally bothering to me is the cultural context , which does not ring true .
<n> In addition , she has a weak grasp of American English .
<n> These problems combined to destroy this reader &apos; s &quot; willing suspension of disbelief .&quot;
<n> : I am tired of books about writers .
<n> I &apos; m more tired of books about academics and universities .
<n> Other descriptions were just so poor that I didn &apos; t know what she meant then either .
<n> The dialouge in the beginning was flat , boring and often times confusing .
<n> It never got any better .
<n> The characters were dull , annoying and stereotypical .
<n> The plotline was never interesting .
<n> Disappointing : I recently got this book and White Teeth and was disappointed in both .
<n> The movie is not as good as it should have been : The movie sucked .
<n> HORRID .
<n> But unusuable due to this problem .
<n> Very poor sound quality to the person on the other end .
<n> If you drive a Tractor - Trailer truck as I do , forget this headset . DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET !!
<n> I &apos; m thinking about CANCELLING my pre - order of collection 3 .
<n> THE SAD :( &quot; LET IT BE &quot;: What goes up must come down ....
<n> This CD proves it .. worn out mad Beatles .
<n> : This movie is absolutely terrible !
<n> Unless you are into blood and evil creatures , do not buy this movie !!!
<n> Dreamcatcher ( Widescreen Edition ) ( 2003 )- Sci - fi &apos; s first ugly look behind the bathroom door !
<n> Dreadful .
<n> This movie is crude , It &apos; s got enormous , ridiculous plot holes .
<n> Nothing special here , move along : Many things in the movie do not connect .
<n> The movie lost me completely in the bathroom scene .
<n> You have to ask yourself , &quot; What &apos; s WRONG with this person ?
<n> &quot; Morgan Freeman &apos; s performance in this movie was also a big disappointment .
<n> But that last little bit after the fight - whose idea was that ?
<n> Tosh , but it has its moments : This movie really isn &apos; t sure what it wants to be .
<n> Add a dash of poor acting and cheesey , unconvincing dialogue .
<n> It sucks and it &apos; s boring .
<n> The movie is just so slow and so boring that I practically fell asleep watching it .
<n> I thought , &quot; Hey , what if that retard was ...&quot; and then it happened .
<n> A classically bad horror ending at it &apos; s worst .
<n> They really DUD IT !!!
<n> As a further insult , the viewer is subjected to tortuous &quot; analysis &quot; via a Rogerian psychiatrist .
<n> These people must have desperately needed the money .
<n> Not what advertised : These are complete crap .
<n> but the pain was far from over after we found this &quot; doozy &quot;. why was this movie even made ?
<n> and the performances by the &quot; legendary cast &quot; range from embarrassing to downright shameful .
<n> Disappointing - feet hit rear wheels : My mother purchased this for my daughter for Christmas .
<n> She was just tall enough for the lowest setting on the seat .
<n> Disappointing .
<n> Defective master ?
<n> Does this mean all copies have defects ?
<n> Cheasy , very cheasy : I am a big fan of the classic kung fu movies .
<n> It is hard to take him and his fighting scenes serious .
<n> ANNOYING !
<n> I am currently waiting on another copy , but if it &apos; s bad I &apos; m giving up .
<n> But the quality seems to go to hell throught certain scenes , flickering colors .
<n> Waste of money : 1st the ipod is expensive .
<n> : iPod Nano &apos; s are exceptionally terrible .
<n> Do not buy them unless you have a spare $ 200 to waste .
<n> Mine broke in 32 Days , and apple will have nothing to do with the repair .
<n> It still worked but the screen was completely damaged .
<n> It worked for a good 2 or so months later & then when completely dead .
<n> VERY Small Type Makes Reading Difficult ( Impossible ?
<n> ): The typeface is very small .
<n> WE didn &apos; t get put in prison .
<n> Put this corporate punishment on TV , where we can all watch it .
<n> This movie is bad .
<n> : And embarrassing .
<n> This book should have died in the slush pile .
<n> Very disappointing .
<n> Dark and depressing : This book started out a little depressing and went completely downhill .
<n> I &apos; m sorry you didn &apos; t like your vacation in Calcutta , Mr . Simmons .
<n> The very purpose of this movie is appalling .
<n> So I buy the DVD , no problem .
<n> The movie is boring , predictable , and irritating .
<n> We all should have rejected the entire movie .
<n> bad , bad , bad : Where to start .. graphics hideous , sound terrible , game play buggy .
<n> Avoid unless u can get it for under a buck !!!
<n> This purchase was a waste of money !
<n> : Unbelievably terrible movie , and a terrible transfer .
<n> If you have a bad disc and have waited too long , WB doesn &apos; t care .
<n> Very displeased with this purchase - should be sold in the $ 1 bin not as a $ 10 item .
<n> Thus , the viewer is forced to watch the Director &apos; s Cut .
<n> @@@@ WARNING @@@@@: BUYER BEWARE !
<n> also my first disc is the wrong workprint copy instead of the final cut .
<n> shame on amazon for shipping known defective products !
<n> Studio Got Lazy On This One : Warner Bros . shouldn &apos; t have released the Director &apos; s Cut by itself .
<n> Archy isn &apos; t quite the same guy and is becoming quite the annoying snob .
<n> what the hell did he just say : Why did Bush knock down the towers ?
<n> Many of us know about the struggle , I don &apos; t need to hear him bitch and cry about it .
<n> TOO LAME !!
<n> Boycott outside of WB studios if you two have issues .
<n> I doubt there are really that many people distressed by the dvd &apos; s lack of commentary !!
<n> And NO , I DON &quot; T WORK FOR WB OR KNOW ANYONE WHO DOES .
<n> Awful piece of junk !
<n> : My son wanted this toy so badly for his birthday .
<n> I finally found the only one in town and it is a disaster .
<n> This toy has since caused tears and frustration .
<n> Not reader friendly : I should have paid attention to other reviews .
<n> But his voice annoys the heck out of me .
<n> That made the entire film a complete waste of time .
<n> You &apos; re left wondering what moron wrote that idiotic ending and why .
<n> Found it rather gruesome , weird and sad .
<n> Defected Book !
<n> I WAS WRONG !
<n> Avoid this seller !
<n> However , it is obvious that there is stress and it is just a matter of time .
<n> Even a bad picture is better than no picture .
<n> They arrived on time , but did not satisfy my ears .
<n> : This is Ms . Cole &apos; s worst offering .
<n> Waste Of Money !
<n> I regret all that now , and I also regret this mouse pad .
<n> Poor Customer Service : I bought the 4gig memory and only one worked .
<n> Never in my life to find a product so poor in quality ????
<n> I am now having a pile of broken plastics ....
<n> Useless crapper .
<n> Winchester name is not wisely used here -- just another cheap Chinese import .
<n> * The ending is simply sad .
<n> IT IS SO SAD AND TERRIBLE !!!!!!
<n> This is my first disappointment .
<n> I doubt that I will watch Auntie Mame a second time .
<n> Boy was I disappointed .
<n> Not funny .
<n> Not entertaining .
<n> Most of the Characters were not described in detail so it was hardly ever sad .
<n> The DVD is simply awful .
<n> Needless to say , a lot of information is lost .
<n> The transfer is so bad that it is virtually unwatchable .
<n> Same dull monotone throughout the cd .
<n> One redeeming feature it may get your youngsters so bored they will fall asleep quickly at bedtime .
<n> one of Mandys worst movies : This movie was one of Mandy Moores earliest movies .
<n> The story is weak and unrealistic , Elija is ok , but plays the part of a stupid dude .
<n> Don &apos; t waste your money , unless you just want to see how a bad script is made into a bad movie .
<n> I &apos; m very disappointed and frustrated by this situation , and the lack of useful customer support .
<n> Should have paid attention to all the poor reviews .
<n> very poor quality control .
<n> Each album after e . 1999 has fallen short of it .
<n> The worst creatures in the world .
<n> How can they do that , so incredible and disgrace .
<n> Their look is soooooooooo disgusting .
<n> How can u guys have such bad taste ?
<n> Really make me wonder , they must be God &apos; s mistake .
<n> Too bad that this dvd was released without getting the bugs out first .
<n> Overall , I love this movie but I &apos; m extremely disappointed at the condition the film arrived in .
<n> My copy was so bad ( just simply too dark ) I could not see any the player in the scene .
<n> A time to kill : This is not a full sized book .
<n> i &apos; m talking boring mixing , decent tracks .
<n> These are $ 200 Japan automatic movements so I wasn &apos; t very happy .
<n> Ruined by an Americanisation !
<n> WTMI : I found The Devils Highway nearly impossible to slog through .
<n> Looks Tough : Looks are deceiving .
<n> The song is not as powerful as it is on the album .
<n> I am ashamed to say that it is not worth the money .
<n> DVD Problem : The rate would be a good 4 , 5 ... but the DVD doesn &apos; t play in Europe ...
<n> The book is poorly edited with numerous typos , sequencing errors , etc .
<n> Waste no time , effort or money tracking this one down .
<n> It is highly inaccurate and biased .
<n> It overlooks the proven cases of criminal satanic practice , such as Matamoros Mex , ( Palo Maiombre ).
<n> Too bad he does not know what he is talking aboiut
<n> A bitter disappointment : This Mellencamp album stunk even more badly than Whenever We Wanted .
<n> I wasted my money on this sorry collection of third - rate material .
<n> Overall just a terrible movie .
<n> Not true at all .
<n> I found nothing funny about it .
<n> What A Mess !
<n> This was the most disappointing film I &apos; ve seen in a very long time .
<n> BEWARE Cut Version !
<n> : I sold this DVD version of Wayne &apos; s Alamo on Ebay after I watched the CUT documentary .
<n> The Alamo with John Wayne : Having seen the wide - screen version , this video was very disappointing .
<n> Very disappointing considering you can &apos; t return videos that are viewed .
<n> Not the Director &apos; s Version : I want to warn others not to make the mistake I did .
<n> This is not that beautiful director &apos; s cut which was issued on Laser and VHS .
<n> Not At All Like Patricia Cornwell : I was very disappointed with this particular book .
<n> The romance was wrong , the Lucy character is disgusting and just rude .
<n> I am so fed up with Kay &apos; s constantly miserable life !
<n> Come Ms Cornwell , you owe your readers more than this poor little effort .
<n> This is so depressing !
<n> although i was disappointed in this book , i will be waiting , patiently , for the next one .
<n> Sorry Patricia , no more for me .
<n> The last two have been just terrible .
<n> She has lost her touch .
<n> Kay Scarpetta seems less organized , more bitter , and her angst colors the entire story .
<n> And Lucy is SO unsympathetic . I guess the worse part is that its not really a mystery .
<n> Better than &quot; Point of Origin &quot; -- but could it be worse ?
<n> Pete became irrational .
<n> Everything else was personal problems and politics .
<n> She is the target of all the villains , and is idolized everyone else .
<n> It &apos; s sometimes difficult to remember that she &apos; s only a medical examiner .
<n> I was disappointed - couldn &apos; t wait for the book to end . Save your money .
<n> Kay is not a likeable person .
<n> Marino is not a likeable person ( is he even a person ?).
<n> Very disappointing .
<n> overall another disappointment in the series .
<n> Very disappointing .
<n> No magic , no juice , no beauty , no heart .
<n> I felt as if the characters were crying out to me , &quot; Please , we have so much potential !
<n> It is just disappointing .
<n> Now she has gotten so lame .
<n> Unfortunate : After waiting for over a year for a new Crusie , Bet Me was a big disappointment .
<n> With two minor exceptions , they were whiney , immature , bitchy , bitter , and boring .
<n> Too bad .
<n> I hate to say this but I will be very cautious about going out and buying her next book .
<n> Ye gods : The worst record I have heard this year .
<n> So Very Bad .
<n> The story was weak .
<n> The actors were weak .
<n> So very bad .
<n> No where did I notice this limitation in the Amazon product description .
<n> this mouse has turned out to be a disappointment .
<n> It sucks : I ordered the Ben Hur DVD and it arrived with the middle piece broken that holds the DVD .
<n> So , the little broke off plastic pieces went to the buttom of the DVD and , of course , scratched it .
<n> I thought it was a story going no where and had a hard time finishing it .
<n> One of the worst films ever made ?
<n> It &apos; s just plain embarrassing .
<n> STP goes Pop ...: What a mistake it was to buy this CD .
<n> The songs were so trite and repetitive that any positive aspects of them were lost to redundancy .
<n> Every song gets worse as you listen to more on the track list .
<n> &quot; Coma &quot; and &quot; Hollywood Bitch &quot; are standout tracks , but that &apos; s about it .
<n> Misleading : I just got this unit and must say that I am disappointed .
<n> A poor book overall .
<n> : Flashes of what could have been a great story , but ultimately disappointing .
<n> Horrid , Disgusting and Vile : I found this to be a work of no redeeming value .
<n> The characters are flat , the plot stale , and the action lame .
<n> It &apos; s not passionate .
<n> Not famous for good reasons .
<n> Stupid ending .
<n> Broke .... After I broke it with a hammer !
<n> No soul and all her malismas are weak , without skills but repetition in the studio .
<n> Just to let you all know negative 5 stars is an understatement .
<n> Disappointing .
<n> BUT , I am so disappointed that she didn &apos; t do it with a BAM !
<n> : I REALLY LOVE MOS , BUT I HATE THIS ALBUM .
<n> New Danger should have been danger .
<n> When I listed to it I couldn &apos; t help and be dissapointed .
<n> only for dick & liz completists .
<n> Another Disappointment : At this point I am undecided about this whole series .
<n> But once again , the execution of this idea sucks !
<n> We can &apos; t always expect a happy ending , but there didn &apos; t even seem to be one at all !
<n> A thoroughly disappointing way to spend some hard earned cash .
<n> Worthless !
<n> Not true to size : I ordered these shorts to replace my husband &apos; s old pair of Russell shorts .
<n> They &apos; re not very attractive when they &apos; re stealing your hard earned greenbacks , think about that .
<n> There are better headphones out there , but if you are dead set on these they don &apos; t sound bad .
<n> Unfortunately , this one doesn &apos; t come close to hitting the mark .
<n> WARNING : Product Rip - off !
<n> : WARNING !
<n> It deserves a negative star rating .
<n> Not even laughable so you can &apos; t sit there and mock it .
<n> It is just boring and dull .
<n> If you try to take thai script to english you will end up with nonsense , and a few laughes .
<n> I didn &apos; t enjoy reading Frugal Families .
<n> This book , Frugal Families , was boring .
<n> Not enough interesting information .
<n> i found the plot dull , difficult to follow , and unconvincing .
<n> SADLY ONE OF THE WORST FILMS MADE !!!!!!!
<n> This has to be one of the worst software packages I &apos; ve ever used .
<n> do not buy this if you have a new system , lots of conflicts .
<n> There were conflicting instructions within the instructions themselves .
<n> It also does not have the great water flow that previous versions have had .
<n> The flex tubing took a lot of abuse and it never cracked or broke .
<n> I used the white one for about 10 years with no problems .
<n> : I didn &apos; t care much for this CD .
<n> basically , a failure - more on Victoria than Vincent : Technically , the writing style is very poor .
<n> Sent the wrong part : The company sent me the wrong part .
<n> Terrible finish to Lonesome Dove .
<n> Very disappointed in Larry &apos; s ending , give me Return To Lonesome Dove any day of the week .
<n> I &apos; m a male BPD and am angry at the oblique , reverse bias so obvious in this book .
<n> She throws a tantrum and gets &apos; support &apos;!?!
<n> ridiculous : I usually enjoy psychology - related books , but this one was ridiculous !
<n> He must be a fool .
<n> Disappointment : This hand - held shower head doesn &apos; t have the usual force associated with a shower .
<n> The massage is weak and not at all invigorating .
<n> I am not happy with this purchase .
<n> The real problem is that the hose they use now is way too rigid for the application .
<n> Even that movie is far and above better than &quot; Shadow Hunter ,&quot; but do not let this discourage you .
<n> Ghost : I triedTo watch this movie six or seven times .
<n> Barely a Mention of Slavery !
<n> It was clumsily wrapped in plastic , the case is damaged and yellowed .
<n> The one for the Town Car is great , but they sent me the wrong one for the second car .
<n> And that is sad .
<n> Dopey movie , bad message : &quot; Grease &quot; is a dopey movie , with silly jokes , innuendo , and fluffy songs .
<n> But this is only part of what is wrong with the movie .
<n> Worst of all is the message it sends : girls if you want to keep your boyfriend go lose on him .
<n> It fades in and out and is difficult to watch .
<n> a disappointment : Sort of like a sausage with a lot of ingredients thrown together but no mixture .
<n> Thats when the problems started .
<n> One day it froze up , but I reset it , no problem .
<n> As one could imagine , it &apos; s completely useless now .
<n> Frustrating , dulls quickly : I have used this peeler only a few times and it is already quite dull .
<n> I don &apos; t care who is in power on earth .
<n> Plus , the killing of Sister Carlotta was a waste .
<n> It was a bad book .
<n> NO MUSIC ???
<n> I &apos; ll consider buying this DVD set when the aforementioned mistake is corrected .
<n> Fire that fool and bring back the original songs .
<n> What a stupid idea to change the music ...... moron .
<n> Worse than a &quot; b &quot; movie : Not worth the time and trouble .
<n> Wondering how any one could have fallen for that babysitter .
<n> However when I went to use it it leaked everytime I would spray it .
<n> Many problems : I &apos; ve owned this watch ( the black one ) for about a year now .
<n> Overall , I think Polar products have gotten worse over the years .
<n> Disappointing : We have only the paring knife from this set , and havebeen very disappointed with it .
<n> The knife lost its edge quickly , and worse yet , fell apart a few months after we bought it .
<n> Okay ... BIG MISTAKE !
<n> A great bit part for Jackie Chan , but a TERRIBLE movie !
<n> This is a waste of money to purchase .
<n> There was no Augustus Pelltier !
<n> I thought she sounded decent on one song and she &apos; s not that great on the first album either .
<n> Very disappointed .
<n> Waste of Popcorn : I saw this movie at the cinema .
<n> It must stands for &quot; A very Bad book on C !
<n> The teaching style is TERRIBLE !
<n> You will only regret the purchase .
<n> Self - Serving : Reading the book was slow and painful .
<n> The writing style is boring and slow to the point of sleep .
<n> I regret buying the book !
<n> Unfortunately , I really didn &apos; t get much out of it .
<n> I found this rather useless .
<n> &quot; Dude , Where &apos; s My Car &quot; was better : Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen this year .
<n> It really was that bad .
<n> This movie is a waste of your money .
<n> He deleted any scene dipicting him as he was originally written , as a bad person .
<n> They should ban these people from any race tracks .
<n> Now fogs immediately and is difficult to see in .
<n> : This movie is SOOOOOOOOOO bad !
<n> And how many times can you say &quot; Shark attack !
<n> If you &apos; re going to see any of these movies , see Jaws : The Revenge .
<n> A shame to kill so many innocent trees .
<n> The author &apos; s argument is simple .
<n> Instead , the author drags it out , and drags , and drags , and drags and ... you get the idea .
<n> Very disappointing product .
<n> I didn &apos; t make a good choice on this one .
<n> Piece of Trash : This book &quot; Doing Battle , The Making of a Skeptic &quot; is really bad .
<n> I was appalled at how bad both books were .
<n> It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use .
<n> This is not a worthy sequel to the legendary JAWS .
<n> It &apos; s stupid , the mechanical shark looks like a giant piranha , and its just boring .
<n> Whatever happened to Amity island ? This peice of junk is pathetically unsuspenseful .
<n> That &apos; s it . A cheap waste of money .
<n> As a child I saw this one also and it scared me , I was in the video saw and decided to rent it .
<n> Not good at all ...: This movie is so awful that you have to see it !
<n> The effects are really bad and they used very similar scenes from the original Jaws .
<n> The photography was so bad that you couldn &apos; t tall if someone was dead or alive .
<n> After I saw it I was really embarrassed for the director , Joe Alves .
<n> &quot; Most of the visuals look cheesy , and the fact that the film is set in Sea World doesn &apos; t help .
<n> Even its 3 - D effects are weak .
<n> You don &apos; t care about them as people so the movie is dull .
<n> Wow .. a shark is in our backyard pool .. how can we kill it .. I know .. let &apos; s go down in the water .
<n> Very , very bad : Where do I begin ?
<n> ( Has Dennis Quaid been in a movie in which drinking wasn &apos; t his main talent ?
<n> THE worst movie ever : I guess I have to give it a score !
<n> Terrible special effects and really bad acting . What were they thinking ?
<n> Just terrible !
<n> Worst Movie Ever Made : This was the worst movie ever created .
<n> I always been an Arnold fan , but boy was I wrong .
<n> I wasted 6 . 50 on a real sleaper .
<n> From the numerous things that made this movie sad was the Bible ignorance .
<n> The taking out of scriptures was real bad .
<n> : A complete waste of money , not even worth seeing .
<n> Not even worth one star -- but Amazon . com doesn &apos; t give an option for no stars .
<n> This movie was really bad ...: Sorry , but I thought this movie was horrible .
<n> Only two other movies are on my list for horrible movies , and this is one of them .
<n> The acting was horrible .
<n> I can &apos; t believe Gabriel Byrne wasted his time on this movie .
<n> It wasn &apos; t an expensive gift but it was a gift nonetheless .
<n> It was very disappointing .
<n> This Product SUCKS !
<n> Lots of stains not listed : I was very disappointed with this book .
<n> I saw it on Oprah and thought that I had to have it because I &apos; m not very good with laundry .
<n> From graphic oral sex ( Michael on Sharon ) to a near rape scene , this movie is just too much for me .
<n> ). Go ahead and call me prude , but I cannot recommend this filthy trash .
<n> It &apos; s a shame : Poor Kirk Douglas !
<n> This CD is an absolute waste of money .
<n> Some parts are entertaining but others are degrading .
<n> Boring Story .
<n> This book failed to deliver either .
<n> The characters stuck to every stereotype .
<n> fuentes : i was unaware that this was an instructors edition and was very upset when i received it .
<n> This book is terrible !
<n> To make matters worse , the story is derivative and cliche .
<n> These are scared little boys - with large guitars ( and that &apos; s about it ).
<n> I even heard ( the usually acceptable ) Rob Riener made a movie about these perverts !
<n> Is the whole male world going crazy ?
<n> Sequins , swearing and silliness : Barney meets the Godfather .
<n> Lots of violence and cussing but nothing interesting .
<n> But don &apos; t take your kids -- it &apos; s very violent . Obviously , I don &apos; t recommend it !
<n> Horrid Film : This is still to this day one of the most awful films i ever saw .
<n> The movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more .
<n> : The worst movie ever ?
<n> It has done a good job for the past 5 years , but a month ago it broke on me .
<n> Mine broke , too !
<n> Hinge broke while crushing a small clove of garlic and the press was less than 3 months old !
<n> * It broke in less than 3 months .
<n> The rest are boring and flavorless .
<n> DRAB : I found this book to be one of the poorer encounters of the Risorgimento .
<n> She provides a lot of detail .. perhaps too much but fails to draw the attention of the audience .
<n> Useless , Horrible , and Filled with Typos !
<n> On every test , it always gives wrong line numbers and misspells many , many , many words .
<n> And to top it off , the answer guide is often wrong .
<n> This was the worst $ 10 that I have ever spent .
<n> I would not recommend this for others !
<n> Couldn &apos; t keep me interested .
<n> My first reading experience with a James Alexander Thom book was , unfortunately , not a good one .
<n> thinking this might be just as good .... boy , was I wrong !!
<n> I think it was a waste of money .
<n> disappointment : I am a big Randy Neuman fan , but did not like this CD .
<n> Bummer !
<n> SUCH A BUMMER !
<n> Not Faithfully Reproduced : This Kindle edition is not accurately reproduced .
<n> Between Loc 2416 and 2447 is a different part of the book . This kind of error is shameful .
<n> Long and stupid .
<n> : I didn &apos; t really enjoy reading this book .
<n> I &apos; m serious , this album is boring .
<n> but on the other hand the lyrics are so bad that i feel dumb for tuning in .
<n> not worth the time of a long time fan : This story greatly disappointed me .
<n> It &apos; s horrible !
<n> Ugly Americanism !
<n> Not happy : When I got my nozzles , they where not what is shown in the pictures , you show here !
<n> We set it up and tried for a few hours , and then we feel extremely disappointed .
<n> kind of boring : You know , I have to apologetically say I didn &apos; t really like this too much .
<n> You won &apos; t miss anything by taking this route and passing on this relatively useless book .
<n> OXO Fail .
<n> I thought they could do no wrong .
<n> But this apple corer / divider was a waste of money .
<n> It does not work any better at all !
<n> The apple gets stuck in it , and it &apos; s a pain to clean .
<n> The middle screw is loose and doesn &apos; t completely tighten .
<n> : Most of the OXO products hold up but this grater broke grating cheddar cheese .
<n> overall , i was disappointed and would not repeat my order .
<n> THE JAZZBAKERY IS A SHAM , AND RUTH PRICE OUGHT TO HANG HER HEAD IN SHAME !
<n> That &apos; s not exactly a compliment for you Mr . Charyn .
<n> &quot; His hatred of European Americans ( whites ) belies his own research .
<n> : Blame a victim anyone ?
<n> Now that &apos; s just sad .
<n> I am very disappointed with this product .
<n> Sorely disappointed : This was on my wishlist for a sometime .
<n> I love salads , but hate trying in vain to dry washed lettuce with a mountain of paper towels .
<n> Sorely , sorely disappointed .
<n> NO , I have owned it for 3 months .
<n> when called they say it was delivered so to bad .
<n> I &apos; ve tried adding a couple ( or more ) paper towels - that didn &apos; t help .
<n> I &apos; ve tried putting less lettuce , that didnt help either .
<n> In fact , Death To The Pixies puts too much focus on some of their lesser , later work .
<n> Pixies were an album band , and compilations only degrade their impact .
<n> This book was not helpful in preparing my driving tour .
<n> The maps have no detail and serve no real purpose .
<n> never made a bad album , but as a trio ; they stunk !
<n> After a few uses the blade seemed to lose its sharpness .
<n> No No and No .
<n> I never cared too much for Aunt Bam simply because she is soo freakin loud !
<n> I decided to be more open minded but that was an epic FAIL .
<n> Not all black aunts are loud and obnoxious .
<n> singer , but she was no acter .
<n> She was tight nahh I &apos; m lying , she was wack and couldn &apos; t write a song at all .
<n> I have read afew and found them to be consistant in quality , that being low , very low .
<n> I &apos; m doubly damned .
<n> I was expecting something a bit more descriptive and was disappointed .
<n> Not the best !
<n> I am really disappointed .
<n> A complete waste of time : This is a terrible book .
<n> If You Hate Your Kids : Smells Worse Than a Dirty Hamster Cage ...: Wait , stop !
<n> I know what you are thinking : &quot; This film is obviously bad , why on Earth did you watch it ?
<n> Nope , I don &apos; t know what that approach would be ; but this film took the wrong one .
<n> Giant explosions and a giant robot attack the wise - cracking guinea pigs .
<n> Negatively speaking this has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that I have ever seen .
<n> I never really cared if the rodents suceeded in their mission or not .
<n> Horrible : Used this cutting board for 8 days before it warped .
<n> Terrible : An experiment : 1 .
<n> I really found this book disgusting , confusing , and morbid .
<n> It was disgusting how she discribed the ritual for her to get pregnant .
<n> What kind of author would actually write about beig a handmaid , especially if it &apos; s not true ?
<n> I was actually traumatized by this book .
<n> But it has a weakness in its teaching sequence .
<n> Why were three teenaged boys so bad to the bone ?
<n> It &apos; s just a high pitch that hurts my ears .
<n> this solo one is not a good purchase ..
<n> Do not under any circumstance waste your time with this .
<n> not the best : This bottle opener is too thin and doesn &apos; t work really good .
<n> Garbage : I couldn &apos; t agree more with the other negative reviews on this site .
<n> the worst movie ever [.
<n> Dont get this movie confused with Jackie &apos; s box office smash Rumble In The Bronx .
<n> Very dissatisfied
<n> Yet another false alarm review : So , here I am at 03 : 34 AM writing a review for a smoke detector .
<n> mad chirping : this product is the obsolute worst and it took me six years to discover this .
<n> we bought our house brand new and it was already equipped with this smoke alarm system .
<n> Based on the other descriptions I am NOT holding out hope .
<n> They send out a different , inferior model .
<n> Lasko did not respond to emails regarding the problem .
<n> Dishonest advertising .
<n> DOA : Almost bought this from Amazon , but instead got it from Home Depot , and avoided the shipping .
<n> Unfortunately this fan was dead on arrival .
<n> The book fails in its primary function , as a reference work .
<n> Misspelling and mistakes dog almost every page .
<n> Did you know that Crassus died in both 55 and 53BC ?
<n> This book is mindless drivel .
<n> I feel sorry for anyone who has actually read this insincere , unimportant , uninformed &quot; book &quot;.
<n> We &apos; re not laughing with you , we &apos; re laughing at you .
<n> No no no !
<n> : The last page of this book was as tediously painful to read as the first .
<n> Butler &apos; s pompous writing is by far a worse sin than any committed by his vapid characters .
<n> To top it off , Drew Berrymore starred in it and this was the most disappointing thing .
<n> She is such a beutiful and talented actress and to see her waste her time off this mess is a shame .
<n> Terrible !
<n> It is an OXO product , what could go wrong !
<n> She is a whiney and weak character who just gets more annoying as the book progresses .
<n> I was just annoyed that I had wasted my time on this book .
<n> Wish I could give it a negative star !!
<n> : This book was one of the most boring coming - of - age novels I have ever read .
<n> Lee Fiora bored the s #*!
<n> Lee failed to evolve in 4 yrs and I could not relate or empathyze with her in any way .
<n> Boring !
<n> The main character of this book doesn &apos; t grow , and she has nothing interesting to say .
<n> She has a miserable sexual relationship that just kind of goes on and on .
<n> Prep : I was so disappointed by this book .
<n> Long , painful and incredibly boring : I absolutely hated this book .
<n> in the scene where he slaps her for being rude and distant to her family .
<n> Marsha Mason &apos; s character is constantly cranky and critical .
<n> Dead Cat Bounce just seemed to meander .
<n> So disappointed with this bowl !
<n> I received a medium , but the cut of the tank is either a large or extra large .
<n> And it is all that , but I have had it for only 2 - 3 months and is already broken .
<n> One of the buckles broke early on during transport or use , not sure .
<n> : From the amount of money I spent on this thing I was extremly disappointed .
<n> I tried a head - cleaner tape but it didn &apos; t help one bit .
<n> Really , the most interesting character is the woman who gets killed in the opening chapter .
<n> This phone is a piece of crap !
<n> I really regret buying this phone !!!
<n> My biggest upset was the battery life .
<n> Needless to say I keep the one I had and it hasn &apos; t got any better .
<n> Susceptible to Humidity : External display failed within one month .
<n> Moisture sensor dot showed red , so Verizon would not honor warranty .
<n> I understand others have had similar humidity problems too , especially with the Motorola phones .
<n> The book is dark and deals with sexual issues and family violence .
<n> I &apos; m not saying the book is without merit .
<n> : Very unhappy with this book .
<n> Black and white pictues of buttons are not very useful in identification .
<n> AWFUL vacuum .
<n> : This vacuum is terrible !
<n> : This vacuum sucks , literally and figuratively .
<n> Both my wheels continually pop off while I am cleaning and it is a total bother .
<n> Unfortunately the video got ahead of the audio and I kept having to stop and restart .
<n> What a loss !
<n> : Very poor IR quality , the ear cushions come off with ease and the kids lost two the first day .
<n> The volume is very low .
<n> Don &apos; t waste your money : I went to see this horrible movie with my father and I was dissapointed .
<n> It is scary , but the plot is stupid .
<n> And how can the family dog die ?
<n> I was very mad about this .
<n> This is a fake !
<n> Jay Anson wrote a fake story .
<n> One Of The Worst Ghost Movies Of All Time : I just don &apos; t see how this could get such good reviews .
<n> It &apos; s an awful movie with awful acting and no horror at all .
<n> The sequels are ok and would get a 5 / 10 from me but this one horrible .
<n> A young family moves into a nice new house onlt to find out it &apos; s haunted and the dad goes crazy .
<n> MGM also did a bad job on this disk for we get a trailer and that &apos; s all .
<n> Don &apos; t waste your money : What a horrible movie !
<n> It tastes awful unless you mix it with Apple Juice and water .
<n> taste awful : smell bad and taste awful .
<n> awful : This is the most bland , uninteresting tripe released this year .
<n> Bad DVD : I like Tom Petty but this DVD is bad .
<n> Poor editing too .
<n> The audio is bad also .
<n> I have a 7 . 1 surround sound setup and this audio just sounds bad .
<n> Awful : The format is silly and the exercises too simple .
<n> I was very disappointed .
<n> God , what a horrible mean and controlling woman -- famous jockey or no .
<n> There was no suspense and the only frightening thing was that I purchased the movie new .
<n> This one stinks , badly .
<n> horrible record !
<n> I was unfortunate enough to see their live show and I must say it is worse than the record .
<n> Hell Yes !
<n> But even with that aside , this is really just pretentious crap , I mean ... hell !
<n> Big Disappointment !!!
<n> The casting was alright , but such horrible writing !
<n> The worst part was their attempt at a girl - girl scene .
<n> A waste of time and money !
<n> I hate bugs and the bugs in this game are driving me nuts .
<n> One bug that is really bothering me is the inability to alt - tab out , or when someone messages me .
<n> The Worst Bellow Book ?
<n> Within a few months of owning the pot , the handle to the water reservoir broke .
<n> No problem , I just screwed it back in .
<n> The handle was permanently broken .
<n> Unfortunately , it has began rusting inside where the spout meets the kettle .
<n> The handle on ours started to come loose within a month or so .
<n> The problem is inherent on the design .
<n> Not Recommended : I like nothing about this kettle .
<n> Tracy : This teakettle is the worst !
<n> The internal fuse also blew - out when I was overseas rendering it useless .
<n> Tried using it in Germany , and it failed .
<n> It is thus completely useless , and I am returning both of the ones I purchased .
<n> Wrong sizing and inconsistent sizing : I received two of these shirts of the same size .
<n> I have shown dogs only 3 years and found this book not very good .
<n> When they sent me the wrong part , I had to pay shipping both ways and a re - stocking charge .
<n> Not worth your time : B and low budget horror is typically my favorite genre .
<n> Unfortunately , this movie doesn &apos; t achieve any of those elements .
<n> The &quot; horror &quot; parts are simply awful .
<n> There &apos; s a scene of a witch stabbing people who have to be standing 20 &apos; away .
<n> 0 STARS : HORRIBLE !!!
<n> Bad acting , bad filming , nothing realy scary .
<n> Poor Quality : Poor quality , will not last .
<n> Not good quality : This is very cheaply made .
<n> Two of the doors on the compartments were nearly broken off upon arrival .
<n> what a disappointment !
<n> My kids have been wanting to see this , but again , I must say no .
<n> Can &apos; t believe I bought this : One word for this cd : HORRIBLE .
<n> I tried to listen to this four times and hated it more with each play .
<n> I can &apos; t begin to tell you how awful this cd is .
<n> This actually hurt to watch .
<n> Waste of Money !
<n> Waste of money !
<n> : I was really disappointed in this title ....
<n> Came damaged but is also cheap : I was disappointed with this product .
<n> The tab is broken on one of the days , which makes it very hard to open .
<n> ? I enjoyed the illistrations but the word &quot; towel head &quot; deeply disturbed both my daughter and I !
<n> horrible translation : i am a muslim myself .
<n> Additionally , it doesn &apos; t do that great a job of sifting even after all that effort .
<n> The flour gets under the agitator and clogs the screen after a few shakes .
<n> I was not pleased with this product .
<n> Audio is terrible : This is VHS to DVD creation that has horrible audio quality .
<n> I absoloutly hated it .
<n> I &apos; m sorry but it &apos; s just bad music .
<n> Damaged book !
<n> The pages would not detatch so I had to cut them .
<n> This left the pages damaged .
<n> Now the book is in damaged condition .
<n> This &quot; Drive I - 95 &quot; was very disappointing to me .
<n> Too bad the edition outdated .
<n> hate it : this movie is a waste of money .
<n> to boring not enough dancing .
<n> errors are abundant : I bought this book as a first step to preparing for the ASTB .
<n> Certain sections left me more confused than when i started due to so many mistakes .
<n> The author should be ashamed to publish something with so many obvious errors .
<n> Not as Helpful as it could be : Very basic book , not a large section for what I wanted .
<n> The Countess in Red : Dreary and SO poorly written I could have cried !
<n> I have seldom seen a work with such flimsy plot and utterly insipid characters .
<n> What a shame !
<n> The picture still works but the audio no longer comes through .
<n> It was broken out of the box .
<n> : This is an adequate ladle , but my husband cut himself quite badly while washing it .
<n> No sir , I don &apos; t like it .
<n> Not Fun : This game is not much fun .
<n> Despicable bad guys inexplicably dying ?
<n> Not very fun : My baby boy never liked this .
<n> All in all a disappointment .
<n> That tells me this is very low quality stainless steel .
<n> Not user friendly !
<n> Corny and meaningless lyrics and pathetic &quot; musicianship &quot;.
<n> I read some of it but don &apos; t care to be categorized simply because I want to know what &apos; s out there .
<n> Unfortunately the other reviewers are spot on -- very bendy handles .
<n> I hate to replace new ( expensive ) items , but I use them every day and am not happy .
<n> If it &apos; s bad - they time you out and won &apos; t let it post .
<n> I have never been so disappointed in all my life .
<n> This is awful .
<n> Amazon should remove this farce from their inventory !
<n> Extremely disappointing .
<n> This wanders around ultimately gets lost and is a waste of time and money .
<n> Flowery descripitons of every detail do not make a good book .
<n> No doubt about it , someone else wrote it .
<n> The plot was improbable , disjointed .
<n> I hate looking for another author !
<n> He desperately wants to see the real world .
<n> Overall this book was not to good .
<n> DON &apos; T READ THE GIVER : IT IS ABOUT A KID NAMED JONAS AND AN OLD GUY WHO GIVES JONAS BAD MEMORIES .
<n> IT IS BAD .
<n> THIS IS SICK !
<n> I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE SOME OF THE THINGS WRITTEN IN A KIDS BOOK .
<n> CHILDREN DO NOT NEED TO READ IN DETAIL HOW JONAS &apos; FATHER KILLED A BABY .
<n> THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINING !
<n> I had to read this for English , and I have hated my teacher since for making me read this .
<n> This book just bored me to death , reading it was like pulling eyeteeth .
<n> After a point , I didn &apos; t even care !!
<n> In short , a creepy book about a futuristic society that bored me to death .
<n> How sad : My step daughter had to read this book for school .
<n> I found this book very depressing and not edifiying in any way .
<n> How sad .
<n> Or I &apos; m just too dumb to read into things .
<n> It is such a ridiculous idea that a world and its inhabitants do not have any feelings or memories .
<n> Scnhier hasn &apos; t found a way to go beyond his own fear .
<n> WORST soundtrack ever : this has to be the worst soundtrack ever .
<n> most of mtv &apos; s soundtracks aren &apos; t very good , but this is the worst .
<n> This made it a difficult text to read .
<n> No matter , the cleaner is useless to me .
<n> its not as good as i expected .
<n> Knockout blackjack , Caro &apos; s book of tells and blackjack blackbelt are a waste of money .
<n> ), but almost certain to fail even on its own terms .
<n> Tai chi beginning practice , David - Dorian Ross : This was a total waste of money !
<n> A lot of Yadda yadda , blah , blah , blah !!!
<n> In other words , NO EXERCISE , just talk .
<n> ! Awful , awful , awful .
<n> I will try it again but now I would not recommend it to others
<n> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog .
<n> OUT OF DATE N A RIP OFF : I purchased this item and to my surprise it was horrible .
<n> It is not true .
<n> The title had NO connection to anything in the book .
<n> : I &apos; m so sad about this book .
<n> One little whisper of wind , it was knocked over and one of the metal frames broke .
<n> Horrible acting , horrible script , horrible effects , and horrible story .
<n> To me , this movie had no redeeming qualities , and it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen .
<n> You &apos; ll learn Flash alright .... but it &apos; ll bore you to death !!
<n> Dino Thunder Sleeping Bag : My son loved the idea of a sleeping bag but it &apos; s not very comfortable .
<n> Mess Maker : My wife must have nearly one of every red Kitchen Aid products .
<n> My last Starbucks grinder failed because of a frayed cord ( from wrappping around the cylinder ).
<n> Unfortunately it will last forever .
<n> Messy , messy , messy .
<n> Also , removable bowl is not very easy to remove ; and requires tweaking to re seat .
<n> Not as good as I thought it would be .
<n> She was an ER doctor yet when it came to danger she was a wuss .
<n> Why did certain people have to die ?
<n> Book has a misleading title .
<n> He is full of lies and Total Mis - Truths !!
<n> i &apos; ve been Wiccan for over 10years and WE DON &apos; T WORSHIP SATAN OR EVEN BELIEVE IN A SATAN !
<n> Besides this idiot claims to to have been a UFO abductee and a vampire !
<n> This book is a long , contrived , boring piece of unrealistic drivel .
<n> The characters are underdeveloped and frighteningly unrealistic ( not to mention just plain stupid .
<n> Possibly the worst movie I ever watched : This movie is not worth the time wasted watching it .
<n> I repeat , TERRIBLE MOVIE !!!!!!!!!
<n> Horrible writing , horrible acting : I just saw this movie .
<n> Only see Sin City if you want to laugh yourself sick .
<n> but it is boring , slow , and long .
<n> child rapists !
<n> brutal murder !
<n> Sin City : Typical Quentin Tarantino film .
<n> It was actually the worst movie I have ever seen .
<n> The characters are shot time and time again , and yet live on with barely any signs of suffering .
<n> Just violence and hookers .
<n> This movie was beyond horrible .
<n> Hate these kinds of releases though .
<n> Boring !
<n> Are male comic - book authors so dull in their senses ?
<n> This movie was crap !
<n> I could appreciate the gratuitous nudity , but the continuous violence was a turn off .
<n> Nothing like the original kong : I don &apos; t like this toy .
<n> Not for aggresive chewers : I have a brutally aggressive chewer ( 35 lb springer spaniel mix ).
<n> She has not done any additional damage to the main body of the ball .
<n> Useless for non chewers : Stuffing treats inside isnt useful as they pop out too easily .
<n> Dog destroyed it within 30 minutes : The toy lasted about 30 minutes .
<n> This printer was listed as NEW but arrived USED AND BROKEN , I did what AMOZON told me too do .
<n> The person that you photographed will have their head cut off !
<n> Disappointed : I bought this phone because of the range and speaker phone feature .
<n> The battery in the handset died after only two months and a replacement never charged .
<n> Some can edges appear to be different heights which probably contributes to the problem .
<n> Not fun !!
<n> I find it very difficult to puncture a can and get it started running .
<n> It seems that the design makes the leverage all wrong .
<n> Disappointed : This device does open cans but it is difficult to position to get it started .
<n> One star is too many : This gizmo is a costly dud .
<n> I must have made a mistake , I thought , so I stupidly bought another $ 25 box of test strips .
<n> Now , the machine simply rejects the lot number which you must dial in .
<n> This is ridiculous .
<n> His time line is a mess .
<n> He space is just as bad as he provides no sense of the geography or the role it played .
<n> Everything about this movie SUCKED .
<n> Learn from my mistake : DONT DO IT .
<n> Awful and Amateur .
<n> Very poor for such a well known company .
<n> I am very disappointed at this product .
<n> It is very disappointing !
<n> However , it is bad history .
<n> This book is very much inferior to Hofschroer &apos; s work .
<n> Not good .
<n> These shoes are boring .
<n> At worst it is over extravagance that doesn &apos; t know what it &apos; s trying to be .
<n> Because they know they can fool the conumer into buying this tripe .
<n> Shameful Packaging : 42 years later and Sgt .
<n> Shame on you Amazon and E . M . I .!
<n> They just didn &apos; t CARE .
<n> Bad book !!
<n> I regret that .
<n> but the end is weak and dumb .
<n> the boy barbie hooks up with is extremely vulgar and wrong .
<n> BORING , repetitive , and not as tough .
<n> Somewhat disturbing .
<n> Total Crap : Pitiful book filled with more conjecture than fact .
<n> waste of time and money : I should have read the reviews a little closer .
<n> : I was incredibly disappointed in this book .
<n> THIS JUST IN : KINSEY MILLHONE LOSES HER VOICE !
<n> But P is for Peril marks the first book by Grafton at her new publisher .
<n> You lost a once - dedicated fan ....
<n> Then the end of the book came and what a disappointment .
<n> It was confusing and left you feeling that you had just wasted your time reading the book .
<n> What a disappointment .
<n> This book was SO BORING I had difficulty staying awake to finish it .
<n> Shame on you Sue Grafton .
<n> P for &quot; P U &quot;: The only &quot; peril &quot; in this book was the disappointment at the end .
<n> What a disappointment !
<n> Worst than the First : Saw I had promise and and descended in to a plot mess .
<n> Let &apos; s not play anymore little games !
<n> I really liked the first Saw , and HATED this sequel .
<n> This movie sucks bad .
<n> : Its about a bunch of people who are locked in a house and die in different ways .
<n> No seriously .
<n> Its violent .
<n> Nothing is cited , even the direct quotes have no citations !
<n> How was this so bad ?
<n> : This movie had two top stars and a pretty good plot , but somehow turned out horrible !
<n> Ive seen a lot of movies recently and this is by far the worst .
<n> I &apos; ll tell you his story : I &apos; m drunk , I &apos; m nobody ; I &apos; m drunk , I &apos; m famous ; I &apos; m drunk , I &apos; m ^%*&%$* dead !
<n> The water leaked out all over the counter and floor .
<n> Will continue to try , but would not recommend it based on my experience .
<n> What was worse was that few if any of the songs even hinted and being memorable .
<n> It is very odd looking .
<n> And way boring .
<n> This is just sick , bring a pillow
<n> I have the DTS version but no DTS processer and had to select the enhanced stereo setting .
<n> So far no other DVD I &apos; ve purchased compares in overall quality .
<n> Not a Good One at All !
<n> But when he is at sea for five days I got tired of reading it and wanted to stop the book .
<n> I &apos; m not sure and I &apos; m probably wrong .
<n> However , if your trying to die of boredom this is the book for you .
<n> Not that the writing style isn &apos; t good , not that the story isn &apos; t interesting .
<n> Unfortunately , this wasn &apos; t the case with Old Man And the Sea .
<n> I recognized the metaphors about life , but I didn &apos; t care because the story just wasn &apos; t engaging .
<n> Rinse and repeat . I thought maybe re - reading it as an adult might change my perspective , but no .
<n> It &apos; s still boring .
<n> addcaptivating ... it was just plain dull .
<n> DISAPPOINTING : I won &apos; t go into the details of the plot itself .
<n> There is very little tension .
<n> What does it matter if someone stole this or destroyed that ?
<n> The completely evil villain ; the sad , ever moral good guy .
<n> Vesuvius in ancient Greece ), you will be disappointed .
<n> B - O - R - I - N - G : Dull and dopey .
<n> Gross .
<n> They &apos; re just really messy and difficult to eat in this condition , so I &apos; m giving two stars .
<n> This woman is an conceited idiot , and this book is a waste of time and money .
<n> Had to wait 2 months for library to acquire it . Have never been so disappointed in anything .
<n> ! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME !!
<n> It was so disappointing .
<n> Boring , Obvious and predictable : I was very disappointed with this listenandlive title .
<n> You could easily feel his pain when he is forced into an asylum for the insane .
<n> However , the book &apos; s heroin , Maddy , was a bit out of control .
<n> Could she be more indecisive ?
<n> After a month there was a problem with one of the pedals .
<n> The problem was fixed for about a month until the same problem reoccurred .
<n> I was very disappointed .
<n> ) Guy With Fin : Sorry to wreck the scene , guys !
<n> I lost my deal . By the way , that scene is better than the whole movie combined . LOCAL EVIL MONKEY
<n> Possibly the WORST movie ever made !
<n> : This is the worst acting in a children &apos; s movie that I have EVER seen .
<n> unbox turned to crap : I hate to say it but unbox has turned to crap !
<n> Spy Kids was okay but this was stupid .
<n> We now constantly have to pop the leg back into place and it causes much distress for my baby .
<n> And lets face it , they get dirty .
<n> Pieces snap out for cleaning , and no paint chips !
<n> It &apos; s exhausting .
<n> It &apos; s boring .
<n> What I found was boredom and frustration , some red herrings , and a mystery not worth my time .
<n> Weak characters , poor plot : I was not a fan of this novel .
<n> It got off to a bad start in the opening chapters because the main character is so unlikeable .
<n> From that point forward , I didn &apos; t care one way or the other what happened to him .
<n> Ray Jackson is a self - absorbed architect , whose wife Leigh leaves him after a fight .
<n> It &apos; s a horrible story , with a confusing plot and no real crime .
<n> acting was fairly poor .
<n> Total Crap !
<n> This author can &apos; t be trusted .
<n> He & his men built the city from the dirt up .
<n> It is basically useless .
<n> Dead on arrival : Our Dell PC wouldn &apos; t boot up with this DIMM installed .
<n> Memory for my Dell laptop : I added this card and every time I boot I get a new error message .
<n> : First problem , the RCA adapter was missing that was supposed to be included .
<n> Useless product : The headphones has a constant hiss .
<n> But that is not the case . Not sure if the signal is just too weak from the transmitters .
<n> The hiss is annoying and unbearable .
<n> Popping noise : Just bought these yesterday and disappointed to hear popping noise every 30 sec .
<n> worthless junk : worthless junk - both before and after &apos; fully charging &apos; [ 16 hours !]
<n> unacceptable level of noise : The popping and clicking noise is unbearable .
<n> I &apos; m very disappointed at this Sony product . So why do some people give five - star rating ?
<n> They don &apos; t have this problem ???
<n> Or just can &apos; t trust some of the online reviews .
<n> 13 PEOPLE REVIEWED THIS MESS ; 11 GAVE ONE STAR : AVERAGE 1 . 5 STARS ?
<n> This mess lost me about 20 IQ points .
<n> hotel condemned : The &quot; Special Features &quot; section said this movie had no script .
<n> Well , the story was okay , but the writing wasn &apos; t very good , unlke his other books .
<n> Not his best work .....: This book Isn &apos; t as good as I would hope .
<n> It is to brief , it gets scary in the last twenty pages .
<n> Disappointed : I read Cry Me A River as a book club reading , and I was very disappointed .
<n> Along with &apos; The Mask &apos; one of Koontz &apos; s worst ever .
<n> Why are the nuts chasing ?
<n> It is dreadful .
<n> Very disappointing and the only album I have ever bought that has been so badly pressed .
<n> Really disappointed after reading the reviews .
<n> I was highly disappointed .
<n> This freakish movie had a flimsy plot , not to mention an unbelieveably stupid ending .
<n> It starts with serial killing and ends on an off - balanced tangent .
<n> I was highly disappointed .
<n> Don &apos; t get your hopes up yet though .
<n> Most of the girls aren &apos; t that hot and a lot of their vaginas aren &apos; t the best looking either .
<n> Hers in the worst .
<n> : Boring video for a couple .
<n> Also the firewire is a pain in the behind its just more money you have to throw away .
<n> : Parents will be forced to slog through weak character plots that move at a glacial pace .
<n> I would not recommend this movie to anyone , and basically ignore that it was ever made .
<n> You were a favorite .... less then one star ... sad James , sad .
<n> : After the total fiasco of The Lake House , I was looking forward to getting back to Alex Cross .
<n> However , this book was a disappointment .
<n> not your vintage patterson : this is a disappointing book .
<n> However I am getting tired of them ... almost as tired as his plotlines .
<n> The Worst Author I Have Ever Read : Patterson &apos; s writing is an insult to one &apos; s intelligence .
<n> I couldn &apos; t finish this book ( a Christmas gift ) it was so bad .
<n> What I got was a terrible version .
<n> I can &apos; t tell you how disappointed I was !
<n> Missing features , limited lifespan : Where is the FM tuner ?
<n> What a waste of time !
<n> Also ripe for blame are political ideology and territorial ambition .
<n> It doesn &apos; t seem reasonable to blame religion for a common human failing .
<n> Clarke has managed to give us no answers , while leaving the story no where to go .
<n> Oh brother ...: After reading 2061 , I had a nagging feeling that AC Clarke was going insane .
<n> It &apos; s sad to see an author slowly lose his skill and interest .
<n> The rest was crap .
<n> And frankly , I don &apos; t think that the monoliths can be beaten by some computer virus .
<n> Ugh : If you want scifi go elsewhere .
<n> If you want an arrogant polemic then this is your book .
<n> What a waste of time ( pun fully intended ).
<n> I really do think Mr Clarke was fighting a deadline to get this one out .
<n> Too bad it &apos; s really poorly constructed .
<n> Santa thought he was bringing a great toy , but it was really bad .
<n> Having a Garage Sale : Stop !
<n> Lame Attempt !
<n> You should be ashamed of yourself Steve Roose .
<n> Hey I &apos; m going to trademark the term video and sue you for making a video , idiot !
<n> Seriously , this thing is so boring it will suck the life out of any party .
<n> STUPID .
<n> Terrible !
<n> I was disappointed .
<n> Not good .
<n> Not good at all .
<n> his worst : Absolutely the worst album of Marilyn Manson .
<n> Buy this CD only if you need it desperately for your MM collection .
<n> Not Lisa Papineau &apos; s Pet : Don &apos; t make the same mistake i did .
<n> This &quot; Pet &quot; is a horrible britpop male fronted band not fit to shine Lisa Papineau &apos; s boots .
<n> This cd is dated 2004 , years after the real Pet broke up .
<n> Disappointing .
<n> The audio mix on &quot; One Day More &quot; is inexcusably bad .
<n> not like the pic : this item is not at all like what is shown in the picture at all .
<n> I feel bad , but I just can &apos; t .
<n> And in case no one else has pointed it out , &quot; simply grande &quot; is an oxymoron .
<n> But I &apos; m boring about this .
<n> But my 2 . 5 - year - old was bored with it and didn &apos; t want to watch it again .
<n> Duped !
<n> Boy was I wrong !
<n> It &apos; s a series from the 50s or 60s with lame graphics and commentary .
<n> Don &apos; t buy this DVD because it &apos; s just not very good .
<n> I was so shocked at how cheap it felt that I cut it in two to see what it was made of .
<n> Memory upgrade : We bought these to upgrade a couple of older Dell computers ... waste of money .
<n> Clumsy : Lousy movie .
<n> Almost as bad as Lost in Space .
<n> It was boring .
<n> Didn &apos; t give me much guidance : I was really disappointed with this book .
<n> What a waste !
<n> I couldn &apos; t get past disc 3 , despite being interested in the story .
<n> And I &apos; m sad to have had to write that .
<n> died : bought the kettle about 6 months ago .
<n> I had the unit serviced and the problem still remains .
<n> Unfortunately it fails to deal with the major issues on dhtml .
<n> I was expecting a lot from this edition , but after watching it I was very disappointed .
<n> The new music score is also very disappointing .
<n> And I won &apos; t even go into how terrible the acting is in the new scenes .
<n> The added scenes were terrible !
<n> but be warned , it &apos; s not the real thing .
<n> For a start the 15 minutes of added footage is NEWLY FILMED and awful .
<n> Not only that , it suffers from really bad lip - sync problems that make it practically unwatchable .
<n> The other disc contains the un - butchered original but unfortunately has a new music score .
<n> NO 3 - D FILM HAS EVER WORKED FOR ME ON TV !
<n> : This 30th Anniversary Edition is pathetic .
<n> Each and every one of these things made it worse .
<n> She &apos; s also the only one who appears to know what is going on and how to the defeat the bad guy .
<n> Poor story , bad acting , crap movie .
<n> Too chatty ; no data , no drawings , poor bibliography .
<n> Sadly nowhere on the page was it explained that this was a MINI version , a pamphlet indeed .
<n> poor quality .
<n> : cheap and poor quality , looks very thin .
<n> I think it is the way waste moneyI would not buy it again .
<n> Not happy that I now have to take time to return and find a different pizza oven now .
<n> Everyone in my class thinks this book sucks !
<n> Reader beware your in for the dull trip of your life !
<n> The reason towards this is because it was dull boring and put me to sleep .
<n> But the lack of any basic formatting made me delete it right away .
<n> The towns people were frightened because the monster was ugly and different from them .
<n> It &apos; s not an easy read , nor a happy one .
<n> It &apos; s filled with obsessive compulsion , depression , denial , murder , and God - playing by man .
<n> THE WRONG ITEM !!!!
<n> not good : If I did not have to read this for school I never would have read it .
<n> Awful : This book is chock full of arrogant , racist nonsense .
<n> Everyone tries but the script is WEAK .
<n> The color is so bad everything looks pastel when any color other than green can be decerned .
<n> I watched this on a home theatre system and the sound was nothing special but alright .
<n> I won &apos; t buy from Amazon again if I should receive another such poor quality product .
<n> Another inferior product by Madacy : bleached out picture and tinny sound .
<n> I regret that I did .
<n> However , the Kindle version is almost useless .
<n> Now we have listen to a solos cd by the world &apos; s dumdest fake brunette .
<n> Not good !
<n> : Is this music screaming or singing ?
<n> I am very unimpressed by her debut album .
<n> Overall , this is not a good debut .
<n> There isn &apos; t a memorable melody in the bunch , and that &apos; s a crime .
<n> Now we have listen to a solos cd by the world &apos; s dumdest fake brunette .
<n> Disappointed - cd empty : I waited over the 30 days to open and test the product .
<n> Bad design , bad headset .
<n> I &apos; ve currently replaced these headphones 3 times . The first two times the microphone died .
<n> Step away for a few minutes or get distracted and Bam .. Lost connection .
<n> Poor Construction : We purchased this Pill Organizer after using the same type for a few years .
<n> I tried to put them back but no luck . Very poorly built - low quality .
<n> It has a 6 month warranty and therefore , I lost $ 80 . 00 . I am very disappointed in the quality .
<n> worst product ever .
<n> The good sound quality is of no use if the item is broken !
<n> We were very disappointed .
<n> One side broke after a couple weeks .
<n> The sound is okay , but the biggest problem is that they don &apos; t fit very well in the ear .
<n> Then I push them back on my ear , but then I lose ALL bass response .
<n> Defective Product : The earphones are defective .
<n> It took a while to recieve the product and the product was defective .
<n> Not a good buy .
<n> I have wasted so much money as I am the headphone queen !
<n> I thought maybe I had a defective pair or I had been too clumsy , so I ordered another pair .
<n> Broken in 3 weeks : I got these to replace my yellow Sony sports headphones .
<n> These broke within 3 weeks .
<n> Unfortunately , I recently found the headband broken inside my gym bag , and now they are unusable .
<n> I do not recommend these since they are much too fragile !
<n> It &apos; s hard to believe the quality has declined so badly .
<n> confused : I just opened it today , and I am disappointed .
<n> I really don &apos; t know if they shipped the wrong item . It is supposed to be 28 &quot; by 3ft .
<n> The sound is terrible .
<n> : We really tried to watch this but the sound was so bad , it couldn &apos; t be understood at all .
<n> I do not like this one at all : I had this music player before , and I have to admit , it &apos; s pathetic .
<n> Atlantis Found Awful !
<n> Smell is OK but nothing so special about it .
<n> Wrong , wrong , wrong .
<n> You CANNOT peel it off , and it looks awful when you are standing looking in .
<n> Just a total waste for me .
<n> There was no response at all - the unit was dead , and all attempts at revival failed .
<n> My bad I guess .........
<n> WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED TO READ !!!
<n> It was written like a really bad book report .

<n> If you &apos; re a cruiser rider you &apos; re all but forgotten .
<n> Does not perform : This is the worst product I have ever purchased .
<n> What a Horrid Waste of Pulp , A Disaster !
<n> My eyes grow Tir &apos; d and my Thoughts grow more hateful towards this Author .
<n> Confus &apos; d and Stupid Astronomers ?
<n> All in all I felt the book totally lacking in character , and not well written - even boring .
<n> : this album makes me sick .
<n> if you think the cover is bad , wait till you hear the music !!!
<n> Food Fight ?
<n> The damn thing &apos; s full of cocaine !
<n> I dunno if this is supposed to be a grown man &apos; s Pixie Stick or something , but I feel cheated .
<n> Imagine my disappointment to find they terminated right in my living room .
<n> That would sound worse and cost more .
<n> What &apos; s this nonsense ???
<n> Book design and illustrations are appalling considering the subject of the book .
<n> The sound quality is poor .
<n> The keychain is very small and not particularly attractive .
<n> AVOID ANY PRODUCT BY SURROUND RECORDS !
<n> I think this movie is boring .
<n> The dialogue tends to sound either suspiciously American and modern , or archly dated .
<n> Waste of time : Hmm , what to say about this game .
<n> The AI was horrible , weapons were bland and boring to fire .
<n> The teammate AI is horrible and doesn &apos; t help at all .
<n> The graphics are horrible too .
<n> Waste of money : If I were able to give zero stars , I would .
<n> This tortilla baker doesn &apos; t do much , and an inferior job of cooking them .
<n> Also the instruction book has , like , 4 pages / 2 recipes and not very useful .
<n> The sound is pathetic .
<n> Talk about disappointment !
<n> Awful !
<n> Now I think I think I wasted my money on that CD
<n> I think to blame is to production quality .
<n> Sorry folks , this is the worst Maiden album ever .
<n> I tought this was the bottom for Maiden , until &quot; VIRTUAL ELEVEN &quot; came out and it was worse !!
<n> Unacceptable for ordering school books , it put me behind on my class . Not reccomended .
<n> sacred hunger : One of the most difficult , slow and overly detailed booksi have ever read .
<n> I tried all three and was unsuccessful in recording or reading the disc on my Canon video camera .
<n> It was that bad .
<n> I like the idea of adopted children coming together to find their mother &apos; s killer .
<n> But it was weak .
<n> Waste of time : I got this film because I &apos; m from Detroit where this takes place .
<n> Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother &apos; s killer .
<n> Usual smartass remarks , guys talking BS , fights , shootouts , blah , blah , blah .
<n> 3 Lads , An American Fool and One Night : A really senseless piece of work .
<n> But even at that it was a disappointment .
<n> Delusions of granduer : Lizzie confuses candidness with insight .
<n> The problem was the game felt hollow .
<n> There was much less of a plot then any of the others in the series , and was overall disappointing .
<n> Disappointing : Information not clear that product MUST be bolted down to be of any use .
<n> Also the actual grining parts do not fit well .
<n> To add to insult the grinder sent appeared to be a return or restock .
<n> I was wrong .
<n> They broke within a month .
<n> missing pages !!
<n> : This film is a disaster .
<n> Ms . Knowles needs to stick to shaking her behind because acting is not a talent she possesses .

<n> People don &apos; t go to plays to feel bad about life .
<n> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY !!!

<n> : I have about 4000 DVDs and have seen bad transfers in my life .
<n> This DVD is one of the worst .
<n> No and No !
<n> Too Ridiculous !
<n> The backwards episode was one of the few - perhaps the only one - on SEINFELD I did not care for .
<n> I cannot enjoy the songs this way !!!
<n> The movie is useless to me , because it won &apos; t play .
<n> I was really looking forward to seeing this film from my childhood , but was very disappointed .
<n> Very frustrating .
<n> Not funny , not insightful , just trendy !
<n> there was little plot .. if any apart from the stripper darla &apos; s struggle .
<n> Just a sad tale of an equally sad boob !
<n> A struggle : I finally had to put this away without finishing .
<n> I found it tedious and not even remotely funny .
<n> This book was not funny .
<n> not funny !
<n> I didn &apos; t laugh once through the first half of it which is how far I could stand to read .
<n> It portrays a pathetic fat slob of a jerk that deserves all the bad that life deals him .
<n> Not amused : The first chapter of this novel bored me to tears .
<n> In my opinion , it was just ridiculous . The worst part of the book was the lack of plot .
<n> What a loathsome , unpleasant bunch of idiots .
<n> I stopped about a third of the way through chapter 2 , they irritated me so much .
<n> I know I &apos; m in the minority , but I wouldn &apos; t recommend this book to anyone .
<n> Terrible : This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read .

<n> : I always knew Miley Cyrus was cold - hearted , but this movie lets us know she contains no emotion .
<n> worst movie ever : The Last Song is in a league of its own .
<n> It is by far and away the worst movie I have ever seen in my life .

<n> Holstein to watch an it does not have closed captions so I am very disappointed .
<n> It was a waste of money !

<n> The acting was horrible , Bigfoot was an absolute joke along with every other aspect of this movie .
<n> battery killer , poor pics : If you like purchasing batteries then this is the camera for you .

<n> A difficult read .
<n> STOP RIGHT HERE !
<n> I am very unhappy with the product I received .
<n> Paid $ 20 on it and they gave me $ 10 back and replied to my complaints with automated emails .

<n> It &apos; s too bad this subject couldn &apos; t have been addressed in a more objective writing .

<n> Enter evil P . A .
<n> Her father is a pig , the man she marries is a pig ( hot , But a pig ) and she is such a wimp .
<n> Though saying all this i think its Mef &apos; s lack of hunger that really lets this album down .
<n> : this album is nominated by me for the worst thing that ever happened this year for music .
<n> The lyrics seemed to be written by a four year old who is retarded .
<n> Unfortunately , the Orinoco card I bought would never talk properly with the Linksys .
<n> They spent the whole book arguing posintlessly about leaving each other .
<n> Terrible .

<n> I was totally disappointed in this book altogether .
<n> : This has to be one of the worst PC books I &apos; ve read .
<n> The characters have become shallow and caught up in personal problems that weigh down the book .
<n> I am most disappointed in the way PC handled the whole plot of Wesley Benton .
<n> Whatever personal problems you might be having .... leave them out of KS lives .
<n> I have gotten tired of Lucy , tolerable of Kay at times , frustrated with Marino and adored Benton .

<n> I waisted alot of nuts
<n> : This guy is such a fake it &apos; s not even funny .

<n> The rest of the compilation ranges from decent to &quot; What the hell is this ?&quot;

<n> So if you &apos; re struggling just stop , wait ten seconds and then you &apos; ll be able to catch the leaders .

<n> Not worth the time : I &apos; ve made it half way through the book and am not sure I can finish it .

<n> It is NOT fun to brush or do anything else except for maybe cutting it .
<n> That &apos; s why I listed it as being durable because you can cut all it &apos; s hair off out of frustration .
<n> We even tried to use shine gel and detanglers , so it was softer , but in no way resembled hair .
<n> the worst toy ever that has been made on earth !!!!
<n> Then i made the mistake of trying to make it work with my tv .
<n> So i figured no problem it i will be on their website .
<n> Wrong , there is no useful information about this remote on the Manufacture &apos; s website .
<n> LAME : Piece of junk .
<n> Don &apos; t Waste Your Money : What a disappointment !

<n> Unfortunately , the driver refuses to load properly after a reboot ( a frequent occurance on Win98 ).
<n> Linksys puts out poor products and equally poor customer service .
<n> : Would definately NOT recommend this product !
<n> Only trouble is this replacement does not work at all .
<n> Waste of money , Waste of time unpackaging it .
<n> Unfortunately , that turned out to not be the case .
<n> First of all , the story is weak .
<n> A Farewell to Arms : This has got to be one of the WORST books I &apos; ve ever read .
<n> DeWalt inferior to Makita ; MaxTool DoubleBilled me !
<n> Beware of ToolKing : If you expect to buy these new in the package , you will be disappointed .
<n> Bad memories from the past .
<n> : The Batman TV series are actually awful .
<n> The bat - gadgets have an awful design .
<n> It is a bitter parody of the Bat .
<n> it was the worst load of garbage .
<n> The plotlines were all begged , borrowed , and stolen .
<n> My brain / senses need ( s ) a day of bad television to wash the haunting memories of a bad book away .
<n> I know that sounds harsh , but gosh , this book was really truly horrible !
<n> Trash : I can &apos; t believe anybody likes this garbage .
<n> What a ridiculous idea .
<n> Too bad that was lost to cheap animation and crudeness .
<n> I am not pleased with the site service .
<n> Disappointed !
<n> : This item was a disappointment because it was much smaller and lighter than I expected .
<n> Both are necessary , and unfortunately the Vogels seem to have forgotten that .
<n> I bought both a used and new copy , I was a double fool .
<n> It was so bad and the acting is way beyond horrible .
<n> This was the most money I &apos; ve spent on a DVD through Amazon . com and I was extremely disappointed .
<n> It was a waste of my money and my time .
<n> Horrible acting , horrible production , hard to follow .
<n> Very dissatisfied .
<n> it gets very boring SOON , and the puzzles and controls can get frusterating . i don &apos; t recomend it
<n> Very disappointing and unprofessional , if not downright cheating .
<n> Horrible .
<n> rusted : The construction of the roast pan is ridiculous .
<n> This is the worst .
<n> : There is nothing good about this movie except for the title .
<n> Bad acting excuse me , atrocious acting .
<n> And the main problem , at 3 hours , it &apos; s way too long . I had to force myself to watch it to the end .
<n> This movie is just pathetic .
<n> War of the Gay - closet sci - fi at its cheapest !
<n> Don &apos; t forget to bring the orrnges and the fake biker moustache !
<n> It &apos; s so bad even Channel 5 wouldn &apos; t show it at four in the morning .
<n> Everything about this home video is substandard bad .
<n> Don &apos; t believe the good reviews this is getting here : this belongs in the trash .
<n> The acting is crap , the special effects are crap , it &apos; s overly long ..... It &apos; s just crap .
<n> don &apos; t believe the 5 - star reviews : Seriously , all these 5 - star reviews are fake .
<n> Hell , anything above 2 stars is fake .
<n> It &apos; s obviously just a cheap riopoff designed to steal people &apos; s money .
<n> I doubt it .
<n> This is so bad nothing can save it .
<n> I mean , film 101 is about color correction and scene melding , and they failed miserably at both .
<n> The acting is wooden and the effects tragic .
<n> So , no wonder . Stay Away !
<n> Where is the original War of the Worlds ?????
<n> the martians looked as scary as the teletubbies .
<n> Also , they quickly lose their form and become misshapen .
<n> Everything else was meaningless fluff .
<n> Large and slow are a bad combination .
<n> not what i expected : This book was not helpful .
<n> I was expecting insightful information , and was disappointed .
<n> Many other people had the same problem .
<n> This dvd is a scam !
<n> It &apos; s boring !
<n> Talk about Britney Spears and The Beatles , and I do not care them !
<n> This was a fraud ...
<n> waste of money : This pan is awful you get what you pay for .
<n> We made one omelette which stuck terribly to the pan .
<n> No biggie !
<n> My first one had a picture but everyone on Skype complained of a loud , intermittent static noise .
<n> Odd spacings , strange characters , missing words .
<n> They catch the bad guy .
<n> ABSOLUTE GARBAGE CRAP !!!
<n> It was likely jeepers creeper and but more realistic than scarecrow .
<n> There performed was terrible , it felt like there be no director at all .
<n> The scarecrow then goes around killing people .
<n> Why I hated the The Story of my Life .
<n> : Wow . This book is beyond horrible .
<n> If any other person wrote this I think many people would hate it .
<n> If her parents haven &apos; t have been rich she would have not gone to college .
<n> But I hated this book so much .
<n> I am not even beginning to explain how much I hated it .
<n> Premise is Old and Tired : I did not find the premise for this movie to hold up .
<n> Van Johson is a frustrated writer with a drinking problem .
<n> She gets ill and dies because of his &quot; malice &quot; towards her while he is drunk .
<n> ONE OF THE WORSE ROAN GROUP RELEASES !
<n> NO SIR !!
<n> This program is a stupid program about the functionalism of dysfunctionalism .
<n> It is a waste of time and money .
<n> No wonder our country is in the sad shape its in .
<n> Too bad the series is one grade below low class .
<n> I find it offensive and appalling .
<n> To me this is not funny .
<n> It is sad .
<n> The power supply failed on the first set .
<n> This set has failed for the same reason .
<n> Derivative , and lacks any internal logic : One of the worst movies I &apos; ve seen in a while .
<n> I can &apos; t say more without giving a lot away .
<n> Re - watch some Walking Dead &apos; sodes instead .
<n> Watered down and held down by a mediocre budget , this movie is bad in almost all possible ways .
<n> There is a scene when Faust is in the grave that kinda rings of the comic .
<n> horrible book !
<n> : This is a useless book for self - study .
<n> Avoid !
<n> This was possibly the most dull and unsightful book .
<n> : This was possibly the most dull , and uninsightful book that I have ever read .
<n> maybe others have had this problem .
<n> The casting is all wrong and I always lose interest .
<n> It &apos; s a shame .
<n> ALL THIS AND WORLD WAR II : I &apos; m gonna wash this film right out of my mind .
<n> It is long and it is dull .
<n> Should be titled Terrible Pacific .
<n> : Film quality wss poor as was the editing .
<n> Don &apos;&apos; t waste your time and money on college .
<n> Sadly , though , the execution was very week .
<n> But then the scarecrow goes very ninja - weird .
<n> The &quot; kid &quot; Lester , is awful , as is the rest of the cast .
<n> Unfortunately , the rest of this movie is tedious and dull to the extreme !
<n> Alas , he &apos; s just as bad as the rest of this torturous pile of dog brownies !
<n> I thought it to be an interesting Documentary but found I was wrong .
<n> Not funny enough , and I didn &apos; t like the charters enough to want to know them .
<n> Don &apos; t waste your money : This album is a disaster .
<n> This is a B - minus film about dirty cops involved in a drug deal .
<n> The dialogue is mindless and insipid .
<n> The photography is dull and the music is awful .
<n> Charlie Sheen is often embarrassingly bad , leaving his dad to carry the film .
<n> Did I misunderstand how the cover should be used ?
<n> However this book depresses me .
<n> The author throws meaningless barbs at everything in his path .
<n> No new information is found in the book that cannot be found better presented elsewhere .
<n> Indeed some of the information is wrong or dated .
<n> The third one just arrived -- and you guess it - was DENTED and had dust and dirt in it !
<n> It died a month ago and I replaced it with a West Bend Hi - Rise bread machine .
<n> They said there was a problem with their ordering .
<n> Heating defective : Add me to the list that received a defective machine .
<n> However , the selections used on the calendar are boring and unoriginal .
<n> One of the absolute worst dvd releases i &apos; ve encountered .
<n> Dangerous ideas : Supposedly Dr . Denmark helped develop the pertussis vaccine in the 1930s .
<n> However , I think the ideas contained in this DVD are dangerous .
<n> If you follow the method outlined in this video , your baby will cry from hunger and neglect .
<n> Uninspired Comedy : This movie is only for die hard Martin Lawrence fans .
<n> : The problem with this so called &quot; comedy &quot; is that we have seen it all before .
<n> This is such a dull &apos; comedy &apos; that only raises a few titters .
<n> Not worth the time to read ...: This book is not worth the time to read .
<n> Who ever heard of a &quot; wild &quot; stallion leading a person to a foal &apos; s grave and pawing it up ?
<n> Neither Patty nor her friends and family seemed real to me .
<n> not good : The dolphins screach , it &apos; s awful .
<n> Warning !
<n> Multiple Problems !
<n> I was foolish enough to buy this CD without carefully examining the cover .
<n> It should also be known that the sound quality of the ACTUAL tracks is absolutely horrible .
<n> Ain &apos; t That Loving You Baby11 .
<n> I couldn &apos; t see any good in the book or the main characters .
<n> After a violent rape scene , I decided I was done .
<n> : Just couldn &apos; t bring myself to finish this extremely disturbing read .
<n> I just wasted one and a half hours watching this movie .
<n> What a waste !
<n> Bummer : Tina Fey - throw Amy a line and get her out of this awful show .
<n> It &apos; s painfully bad , dimwitted and stereo - typical banter .
<n> It has no table of contents and no other apparent way to look around for recipes .
<n> The recipes are simple but to my mind the taste is just not good enough .
<n> And no padding !
<n> poor quality transfer : I loved this version of Dracula however the DVD video quality is terrible .
<n> Poor quality image for the first third of the DVD : This was a disappointment .
<n> -- was , regrettably , more than my stomach or patience could bear .
<n> After a couple of irritating chapters , it has been placed on the reject pile .
<n> However the speakerphone volume is too low and the recording quality poor .
<n> Also , there was distortion while speaking on the wired handset that was bothersome .
<n> don &apos; t fit the clippers : I ordered these to fit the blades I was using .
<n> First , there is a big problem with the compression ration used for this movie .
<n> shame shame shame : Dersu is one of my favorite films of one of my favorite directors .
<n> What a shame it did not get an adaquate treatment on DVD .
<n> The pictorial quality is inferior awful and disgusting .
<n> That didnt seem to help at all .
<n> It was disgusting !
<n> Unfortunately , one of the VHS versions being offered , the 83 min .
<n> A classic masterpiece ruined with very poor audio .
<n> : The film was everything I expected except the audio is exteremly horrible .
<n> The vloume rises and falls and is interlaced with intermittent annoying static clicks .
<n> It is unacceptable .
<n> It was very scarey and I thought about it nightly for months .
<n> However , the video was terrible .
<n> : I hate watching dubbed movies .
<n> what a disaster !
<n> May was a nag and should have shut up about his father .
<n> Who wants to read that crap ?
<n> I was , unfortunately , very disappointed and couldn &apos; t even finish the book .
<n> What &apos; s really scary is that plenty of Americans think that this movie is factual .
<n> the movie is a fake .
<n> lies all the way .
<n> The thing that scares him the most is someone who thinks for themselves .
<n> It will turn you into a big fat bloated greasy whale and it severely lowers your IQ .
<n> IT SUCKS !
<n> LIES AND NONSENSE .
<n> ARE PEOPLE REALLY THAT STUPID TO BELIEVE THIS NUT !
<n> Not a chance : This is the most disgusting thing I have seen .
<n> It is a disgrace that he uses the tragedy of Columbine to gain fame and fortune .
<n> I would not recommend anyone to waste his or her time .
<n> Moore &apos; s cynicism and just plan meanness at times has no home in working class America .
<n> But it is highly deceitful .
<n> Knee - jerk liberal tripe scapegoatism at its worst .
<n> : The epitomy of revisionist history / liberal misinformation at its absolute worst .
<n> VERY MISLEADING : Oscar ...??????????????????????
<n> This is one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen .
<n> It was very disappointing and very misleading .
<n> Shame on him .
<n> this movie is as much a documntary as star wars is .
<n> I For One Will Avoid This Movie At All Costs After Wasting Money To See It In The Theaters .
<n> If I were superstitious I would say there is something evil loose in the world .
<n> Moore also uses the veneer of a documentary style to disguise lies in narration and editing .
<n> Watch this movie .. but don &apos; t accept any of it &apos; s &quot; facts &quot; or conclusions .
<n> LOAD OF GARBAGE : ALL OF MICHAEL MOORE &quot; S FILMS ARE LIES .
<n> ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WASTE TIME WRITING ABOUT THINGS THEY DON &apos; T KNOW ABOUT .
<n> ASSAULT WEAPONS DON &apos; T HAVE TO BE FULLY AUTOMATIC .
<n> NOT LIKE MOVIE GUNS . THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN DID NOT BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS .
<n> IT BANNED HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES .
<n> THE CRIME RATE IS SCARY . BUY A GUN BEFORE YOU TRY TO TAKE MINE
<n> What a farce : This &quot; documentary &quot; should be called a propagandamentary .
<n> A damn shame .
<n> This was the only problem I have ever had with the many purchases I have made .
<n> Awful book : Really silly .
<n> Melodramatic and the protagonist is uptight and selfish and thoroughly dislikeable .
<n> Avoid sappy teenage drama ! Dr .
<n> Utterly Racist !!!!!!!!
<n> 1800s fiction : This book is boring for one thing !
<n> After long last , the movie came out about a year ago but it was not a very good movie .
<n> The language is a problem too .
<n> Mormons teach that men can become gods ; the BOM makes no mention of such a doctrine . It is fake .
<n> Jesus wept !
<n> If there is one thing I despise , it &apos; s repetition and this book is loaded with it .
<n> I am an unbeliever and I have many , many problems with this book and it &apos; s belief system .
<n> Saves you a hell of a lot of money to do it that way .
<n> Insulting : Every page insults with racism , romanticized prostitution and corruption .
<n> Broke after ONE DAY !
<n> : The clasp broke after just one night .
<n> DEAD : I got this for school and it died after only a couple of weeks .
<n> Worst Book Ever !
<n> : If it was possible to give a book negative stars , I would give this one - 2 , 000 of them .
<n> You will regret it for the rest of your life .
<n> Then I read the book and who it was diffrent from the movie and not as good .
<n> The book was boring and I found it really abnoying .
<n> Disappointing : This book was just a plain disappointment .
<n> Scary !
<n> This book had a lot of repetition , no plot , and a truly horrible ending !
<n> Another piece of mediocrity falling victim to its own hype .
<n> The entire book was one huge rant about how bitchy Andrea &apos; s boss was .
<n> &quot; The Devil Wears Prada &quot; is just dreadful !
